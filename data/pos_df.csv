Although the initial assumption with regard to the state of the quarto text has been shown to be of less importance for the choice of __reading__s in this list than one would have imagined, it is, of course, of great importance in the choice of other __reading__s, those, that is, in which Q and F are variant but in which Q is invariant, and for which we have, therefore, fewer data.
An essay describing a bibliography can hardly make pleasant or digestible __reading__ but it is full of stimulating suggestions, and the bibliography itself will remain a useful guide to those who wish to pursue them.

If R proves to be contaminated it will have little or no value; if it has 'inherited the correct __reading__', it will be invaluable; if it represents an intermediate version of the poem, it will not only be of great intrinsic interest, but also may show, at any point affected, that the difference between B- and C- is the result of revision.

Moreover, his method of treating his subject provides, by the wide __reading__, humour and enthusiasm which it embodies, an excellent antidote to the notions either that philology need be a dry subject which has to all intents and purposes had its day, or that material of academic origin must necessarily be dull and ponderous.
The early __reading__ of Pierre Bayle.

In the conclusion of this poem Sir Herbert adopts two questionable __reading__s from the manuscripts.
Occasionally, Professor Heilman attempts to justify his symbolic __reading__s by showing their superiority over other __reading__s, but his technique here is no less arbitrary than that which he employs in making the symbolic con- nections themselves.

First, the outstanding causes of the return to enjamb- ment are the increasing recognition that the Popean couplet is monotonous in a lengthy poem-an impression that was inten- -sified by the __reading__ of Milton; the decrease in couplet poetry about the middle of the eighteenth century, which provided a greater opportunity for experimentation and taught the more varied harmony of Miltonic blank verse and stanzaic poems; the new, more romantic themes that came into vogue about the middle of the century, such as sentimentalism, melancholy, and heroics, which, by their very nature, required the legato music of enjambment rather than the staccato jolt of the closed couplet; the growing recognition of Dryden as an artist, rather than a hasty, careless craftsman; and, to a lesser extent, the revival of interest in the pre-Restoration poets.

I draw these conclusions: (i) where DLH and R are in opposition, the source, when available, must help to decide between the two __reading__s; (ii) where DL are opposed to RH, the presumption is that they represent a departure from the author's text; but (iii) their __reading__ should not be rejected mechanically; and (iv) where all the MSS.

Richardson's prolixity and repetitions did not trouble a leisurely __reading__ public who (we have Johnson's word) were more interested in the senti- ment than the story.
Briefly, three of the unique __reading__s in A are slips of the pen, easily corrected by an intelligent copyist (geslcecce, dryhten dryht domas, rehwis- nisse); one is an Anglianism, which any WS scribe might eliminate (rec, glossing fumus; WS Psalters smic); and three show a pattern of sub?

Warren's political novels are far from being traditionalist or conservative; the humanism of Allen Tate, that has led him to Roman Catholicism, is different from, even antithetic to, that of Ransom and Warren; Ransom, for all his modernism, has always been a bitter opponent of T. S. Eliot (it is valuable to be reminded of this, and tells one something about them both); and, renowned as they are for their formalism and their regard for close __reading__, they have all (except Brooks) been led to base their criticism on extra-literary criteria: as has Mr Bradbury himself, for the best thing in his book is a lucid and admirable account, in his preface, of his own critical position, and the need to move from purely aesthetic to more general standards.
The information provided and the form in which it is presented make for good __reading__-so good in fact that anyone intending to consult the D.A.

To say that the book makes heavy __reading__ as a whole, that it convinces us of the vanity and triviality of the literary theory of the age, and that it is less revealing of the nature of the drama produced at the time than its editors or their publishers would seem to suggest, is not to deny its value as a guide for the learner and handbook for the teacher of the period.

tion arises whether such a seemingly unorthodox __reading__ of emptiness as the condition of hope is defensible, whether there is any precedent in literature for such an interpretation.
I, save for a very interesting and most thorough biographical study of the author, makes rather heavy __reading__; in fact, it will only become really intelligible when the texts have appeared; then only will the elaborate discussion of the manuscript tradition, which occupies the major portion of the volume, fulfil its purpose; then only will the many pages of variant __reading__s receive a context that will enable us to judge their importance, and to approve (or otherwise) M. Henry's assessment of them and his ultimate choice.

The parchment is also unusually coarse in texture at this point, so that a poor absorption of ink might possibly account for the faintness of the s. Inasmuch as the foregoing __reading__s complete a new decipherment of the extant Skeireins leaves, it is important to determine how many emendations are still required to make the text intelligible.

(v) The result of the notion that images are 'arguments' was that 'The nature of their terms might range from the most subtle of abstractions to the most ordinary of daily objects', and that their chief characteristics would include subtlety, logical power, ingenious or startlingly precise relationships or parallels, 'a certain ""obscurity"" due to logical complexity or tenuous attachment-but an obscurity capable of becoming sharp ""clarity"" upon thoughtful __reading__'.
It shows the wide __reading__ in which young graduates are often better employed than in the premature specialization of research.

Mrs. Whiteley's second line of argument, her appeal to 'the evidence of our experience in __reading__ verse', not being based on statistics, is inevitably the ex- pression of apersonal experience and so cannot carry much weight with those whose experience is directly opposed to hers; who, in __reading__ English verse, are quite unable to hear, or even conceive in their minds, the ghostly patter of feet against which is counterpointed the actual rhythm of each line.

Nor has Mr. Honigmann shown that the indifferent __reading__s are not likely to have come from the scribe or compositors; those __reading__s he has gathered from Troilus and Cressida, Othello, and King Lear do not prove his case, for even granting, as some editors have not, that they are indifferent, they do not of themselves proclaim their origin from the author's pen any more than compositorial corruptions show clearly the marks of the printing-house.

Often we cannot be sure whether he makes suggested changes because of a compliant nature, whether he allows editorial al- terations to stand in later editions out of laziness, whether he reverts to earlier __reading__s out of per- tinacity, or whether there is reasoned conviction in support of his actions.
He is so anxious to avoid the modern sin of merely __reading__ the poem, instead of __reading__ the poem as an object in history, that he neglects the principle, rather grudgingly granted in his introduction, that 'focus on the text is absolutely necessary if we would understand the meaning of a particular poem'.
There is a short annotated list of further __reading__s, and there are notes on the contributors.
The reader can arrive at his own judgment by simply __reading__ chapter xl of Vor dem Sturm to which Demetz calls attention.
forest's tale that the roles of Polonius and Ophelia, altered almost beyond recognition, were created; the adaptor was then __reading__ with attention to detail.
Here he occasionally improves on and simplifies his earlier __reading__s.
Inside these restrictive limits, Mr. Wiesenfarth proves a good guide to the 'right' __reading__ of these 'minor phase' fables.
Now in paper with a larger trim, the two chapters on Process have been combined into one, a unit on Satire has been included, many of the earlier __reading__s have been replaced with new pieces by well- known modern authors, and a new Finalities section dem- onstrates the interrelation of patterns and types in good professional writing.
Anyone who cares to materialize this abstraction by taking a cardboard box, labelling it accordingly, and then __reading__ this sixth chapter with the box in front of him will be fascinated by this ingenious demonstration of the symmetry of our apparently complex modal verbs.
Elementary principles of rhetoric are illustrated in earlier __reading__s, while more advanced principles are reserved for later sections.
The second half of her paper contains an analysis, shrewd, sober, and factual, of the special excellences of St Catherine's doctrine, a very reasonable comparison of her with St Bridget of Sweden, and clear indications of how __reading__ of the Italian ecstatic can deepen and enrich our understanding of her English contemporaries, amongst whom the author finds Julian and Hilton most worthy to compare with Catherine."

The six stresses of this line do not make themselves known at a first __reading__.
There remains the third problem, the reason why the poet added the incongruous, and, at first __reading__, unintelligible comment in the fourth line.
~ Though no one __reading__ the letters could miss FitzGerald's sense of kinship with Omar, who to what he predicts as Cowell's amazed repugnance ""breathes a sort of Consolation to me!,"" ~' and with whose accurate though unliteral rendering FitzGerald is clearly first concerned, we must see that he suggests for his audience a rather different reward from the recovery of the quatrains as Omar wrote them.
It would be unfair to state this without offering any corroboration, so I will append some examples, giving the poem number and line reference from Mr. Pinto's edition before the first __reading__ in each case, and the page-reference from Enthusiast in Wit before the second: vii.
It is true that their style is occasionally compressed enough to call for a second __reading__, but this is a trivial defect in their present useful form.
It can be fiddled out on a second __reading__ and found to make perfectly adequate prose sense.
But these references are placed so as to be virtually meaningless at first __reading__.
This means that, on first __reading__, some of the earlier passages border on the incomprehensible: es ist als das reine Erleben des DaB, des Da-seins, gerade das, was im Wirklichkeitsverhalten fehlt.
This list may somewhat puzzle the bibliographically innocent, for twenty-two of the __reading__s are described as only apparently variant and thus the result of bad inking or of broken or dirty type, and only one __reading__ is identified as a true press-correction.
The earlier book is certainly subtle, and it is far more complex than appears at a first or second __reading__, but I believe that explication of it on the Finnegans Wake pattern is mistaken.
Not many of our colleagues could sign the statement that 'complete appreciation begins with a second __reading__ of La Comedie Humaine' (p. xxx).
Some of his remarks appear at second __reading__ less tightly packed with New Light than they did at first, e.g.
For on a first __reading__, the scenes in this story, like those in a newsreel, appear to have only the most casual connection with one another.
If I follow Mr. Stein's reasoning, he would favor destroying all such records, because each one imposes on Shake- speare's text the one __reading__ which the individual actor thinks it should have, thus narrowing the poet's vast amplitude."

The phonetic versions are based upon the author's form of RP, in a style of delivery described as 'formal colloquial', or one suited to __reading__ aloud from books.
It is frank and bold of Dronke to offer translations everywhere, but, if they are aids to __reading__, they should be closer and more accurate.
But it is Pope who comes out best, and on whom the general reader receives what he is still inclined to need-an eloquent as well as critical persuasive to __reading__.
The lectures on Homer had come several months earlier and he had read them nearly through; The Popular Educa- tion of France reached him only the day before, but he looked forward also to __reading__ it.
We are accustomed to __reading__ Fredson on the subjects of bibliographical evidence, or tragedy of revenge, or reviews of editions of Renaissance drama- tists.
Enough has been said perhaps to suggest that these studies do not present a new explanation of literature so much as they encourage and sketch out a new kind of approach to __reading__: Ce lecteur complet que j'imagine ... lira done l'oeuvre en tous sens ... jusqu'a ce que lui apparaissent le centre ou les centres de convergence (xv).
Editor: ELSE M. FLEISSNER, Wells College Critics: John Cary, Andre von Gronicka, Hans Kohn, Werner Neuse, Leonor O'Boyle, Reginald Phelps, Helmut Rehder, Jack Stein, Roger Wells The list is the result of a relentless process of elimination guided by the following considera- tions: to issue an invitation to __reading__ rather than a comprehensive survey; to include only books still in print or about to be republished; to concentrate on those aspects of German cul- ture which the student or teacher or general reader of German literature would be less familiar with and yet would need in order to supplement and support his literary __reading__s.
The real question, then, concerns whether or not that under- standing is to be confined to __reading__ the action as a kind of ideal meditation."
1960,pronoun,3,0.003464203233256351,66.66666666666666,"In these accounts-and one would select in particular his critical analyses of the Puritan poets, of Whitman, Emily Dickinson, E. A. Robinson, Ransom, Williams, Marianne Moore and above all Stevens, on whom he is superb-great care and subtlety of __reading__, much of it __reading__ in difficult modes, is combined with an appreciation of the significance of those modes in the general formal development of American poetry.
He has inextricably intermingled public and private in yet another harmonious fusion, all of it sp__reading__ out- ward in concentric circles from the focal point of satire as itself a reconciliation of opposites and, simultaneously, the glass of Pope's description of the Scipios as duo fulmina belth (Aeneid VI.
To produce laughter of this kind was, of course, all part of the author's intention as set out in the prologue to Part I: __reading__ the tale, he tells us, the melancholic is to be made to laugh and he whose disposition is naturally merry is to be made to laugh louder."
1970,adj,281,0.3200455580865604,56.58362989323843,"They strike an uneasy balance between older and newer styles of criticism, and the result is an odd mixture of close __reading__ and wider __reading__ of what has been written recently about the context of Augustan and Victorian poetry.
It is not that one wants to substitute exact textual sources for a sensitive formal __reading__ of the picture; rather, as is usually the case in the greatest Renaissance imagery, the two belong together ab initio.
L, being free from the omissions of C and from the interpolations of the other copies, is basically the best of all the extant texts, but it contains a large number of minor corruptions absent from C, so that, if a choice has to be made, the only one open to an editor is to print both C and L. Yet the fact remains that the other four copies of the romance contain widely divergent __reading__s, and it seems a pity that a reader whose appetite has been whetted by Dr. Mills's interesting and very competent demonstration of the complex interrelationships of the six texts has to go through the laborious process of consulting an appendix in which the most important variant __reading__s are listed in no less than seven different sections.
Discussion of brief __reading__ distributed to all at the session, plus critique of the discussion to in- quire into the nature of reader response.
The sum is a major __reading__ of Faulkner by one of our fore- most twentieth-century critics.
Such work is urgently needed, for the effect of much recent Shakespeare criticism, with its concentration on an 'internal' __reading__ of the plays or their relation with preceding and contemporary English drama, has been to make him seem rather parochial.
The fullest critical treatment of Flaubert's style in over fifty years, this book offers an introduction to the novelist through illuminating __reading__s of the entire body of his work.
Its aim is to prepare its audience for an appreciative __reading__ of Guicciardini's last and greatest work, the enormous Storia d'Italia, a book already widely admired and quoted, but commonly, in its entirety, flinched from.
For the most part, however, the introductions are a quick run-through of other men's ideas, showing Mr. Maclure's wide __reading__ but nothing of the perceptive, in- dividual approach that we have come to expect from this series.
It is the first serious attempt to bring the central concerns and critical distinctions of contempo- rary, 'post-structuralist' European thought to bear on an extended __reading__ of a major American author.
It is an abstract and difficult text, with very little plot and few characters, which does not make easy __reading__.
At times the subject matter and the level of argument do not make for easy __reading__ but, without disclaiming against Herrera's poetic vocation, the author has contributed a valuable study of prose writings which have been unjustly neglected.
Though hardly companion pieces, the articles make interesting __reading__ in conjunction since both interpretations diverge from traditional scholarship.
TECHNICAL ENGLISH Writing, Reading, and Speaking Third Edition NELL ANN PICKETT & ANN A. LASTER Now emphasizing industrial communication needs, this edition features a new section on analysis through comparison-contrast; updated chapters on business letters, report writing, and oral communication; new __reading__s on computers; recent applications of the laser, and humanitarian- technological values; and an expanded handbook of usage.
(The long passage on The Merchant of Venice quoted above is the most elaborate justification for the thematic __reading__ of any play that I could find after a considerable search, and it is completely general and completely circular, being in fact, as was noted, nothing more than a spelling out of the assumption.)
Catalogues of stylistic description quickly pall if they are not integrated into a personal __reading__ of the text in question.
There are many sensitive __reading__s: for example, on fashion-writing as a form of literary spectacle, on prose- style expressing the movement of dance, on 'silence' in __reading__ and in the theatre, on hermeticism as a guide to significance, on the 'precariousness' of language when the subject of the writing is writing itself.
His findings, based on an attentive __reading__ of Giraudoux's novels, have the merit of confirming in a convincing and acceptable manner most of what was already known about the imagery of Girau- doux, and his fairness of judgement is particularly welcome.
A certain notion of history or of literary his- tory, like a certain notion of determinable __reading__, might indeed be an impossibility, and if so, it might be better to know that, and not to fool one- self or be fooled.
Pauline Yu's comparative study was described as stimulating and instructive __reading__ ""for all of us who are benighted about the East-West correspondence in lyric poetry.""
Given that Salvador is acutely sensitive to the problem ofhomonymy and that he must cut his way through all the errors of his predecessors as well as establish his own case for settling on, for instance, a particular Juan de Medina, this section is not easy __reading__ but will be essential for future reference and constitutes a model of how such investigations should be conducted.
The need for, and lack of, such a balanced and con- textual __reading__ is at all times apparent in the monograph, but is needed not so much to allow for special pleading in some especially unpleasant contexts as to demonstrate the means by which so genuinely talented and influential a man as Lindsay surely was could have been so uneven and have sunk and wallowed in such bitter, elitist, and irrational depths.
When in The Spain of Fernando de Rojas Gilman takes one rhetorical question of Pleberio's out of a ragged sequence of almost forty (and a large number of apostrophes) and presses it to yield a mystery, the reader may well call this selective __reading__.
General resemblances can be found in Scott's account of his early __reading__, love of historical topography, and imaginative re-vivifaction of events.
Statistical surveys make for hard __reading__, and David Lake's enthusiasm for his subject, and his thoroughness in presentation, lead him to make no concessions; he is not concerned at all with the literary or dramatic quality of the texts he writes about, but only with quantifiable elements in them that can be assessed in relation to the matter of authorship.
The English translations, imitations, and commentaries were of course influenced by the Latin and would have reinforced Johnson's literal __reading__ of the rural virtues.
First, the CSE is chiefly concerned with editions that can be called ""critical""-edi- tions in which every word of the text is subject to the critical scrutiny of an editor, who may decide, after careful assessment of the evidence, to alter certain __reading__s in the copy-text or to suggest alternative __reading__s.
But the problem with the book is not to be solved by choosing spirit over body; the intellectual framework is simply too large for the subsequent critical __reading__s, a fact which need not prejudice readers against Rogers's often provocative and good __reading__s of the poems.
In the new sentence, the ""semantic environment"" specified by ""cold day"" blocks one of the possible __reading__s of ""light,"" and the result is a perfectly straightforward utterance.
The style sometimes makes hard __reading__, being discursive and close-packed, knotty with qualifications and elaborations interpolated within a sentence, yet always sensitive and profoundly argued, if perhaps a little over-ingeniously.
The great virtue of his work is that, by analyzing in greater or less detail some twenty-odd repre- sentative poems of Landor's, many of them quite unfamiliar to the anthology reader, he suddenly makes clear what delights there are in Landor's artistry, how rewarding is a careful __reading__ even of the poems that seem thrown off almost as casually as familiar letters.
In the development of alternate __reading__s there is a balancing of purposes.
Among his favorite __reading__ he included the Odyssey (as I see it, the escape and homecom- ing rather than the deadlock and entanglement of the grander Iliad); Poe and Emerson (both of whom deal with efforts to master supernatural forces by natural ones); and such romances as The Last of the Mohicans, The Prisoner of Zenda, and The Jungle Book.
It seems to me that, as can too easily happen with the sort of criticism that is primarily a sympathetic __reading__, the result is mainly a rearrangement and rephrasing of what La Bruyere says.
My aim in raising these questions is not, however, to produce yet another new __reading__ of Tess or even a "" correct"" approach to Hardy.
In his description of the ""short re__reading__s,"" the two processes usually referred to by ""interpreta- tion"" do not seem very sharply distinguished.
A native ear is not an unambigu- ously beneficial critical implement, as truly close __reading__ demands that the language under scrutiny, even if one's own, acquire the unfamiliarity and vividness of a foreign tongue.
Where early __reading__s of any sort exist, however, they should be examined as potential evidence of meaning and form.
Price to be announced The Metaphysics of Darkness A Study in the Unity and Development of Conrad's Fiction ROY ROUSSEL In an attempt to identify the common vision unifying the apparent diversity of Conrad's novels, the author first examines the body of his fiction in comprehensive __reading__s of most of Conrad's major works.
If only the immediate contexts are considered, the possibility of a direct match between the scenes- that Rosalind is weary (sad) in both cases-seems initially a strong one, contradicting our preferred __reading__.
Jack- son resists the temptation to try to recreate the atmosphere of those London days; he sticks to texts, not for full-dress ""__reading__s,"" but for implications of influence.
The interpreter of myth should re- sist literal or moral __reading__s (Reynolds tends to equate them), lest the excesses of the gods be taken as exemplary.
His own wide and observant __reading__ is often apparent, and occasionally he takes us on a literary tour, giving us glimpses, for example, of The Revolt of Islam, The Mayor of Casterbridge, 'A Plaint to Man', 'God's Funeral', Bagehot and Hume, Crabbe, The Woodlanders, The Well-Beloved, and 'Epipsychidion' before bringing us to 'The Chosen' (on which important evidence in The Woodlanders seems to be overlooked).
We call the method ""unled choral __reading__,"" which is similar to ""responsive __reading__"" in church.
These sad love stories of a domestic affection which nevertheless introduces the uncanny, the alien, the parasitical into the closed economy of the home, the Unheimlich into the Heimlich, no doubt de- scribe well enough the way some people may feel about the relation of a ""deconstructive"" interpretation to ""the obvious or univocal __reading__.""
Todorov's contention is that an allegorical __reading__ kills the ""truth"" of the story as story.
It requires access to great libraries, very wide __reading__, great patience and self-disci- pline, excellent organization, and above all a very clear head.
Fish contrasts the sensitive reader's movement in 'L'Allegro' 'from linguistic event to linguistic event with almost no hostages from ... previous experience' to the 'self-consciously strenuous' __reading__ required in 'II Penseroso'.

In the texts the manuscript spelling has been preserved, with only a few minor adjustments for the sake of easier __reading__, but with modern capitalization and punctuation.
He has several sensible points to make, although the book as a whole makes rather difficult __reading__.
Though no single __reading__ may be definitive, the written language of a novel is always translatable into speech, while an irreducible difference exists between human vision and any representation of it, even the most literal, possible in an image.

What good __reading__ is Cibber's adaptation of Richard III in Vol.
It should have been mentioned that the alternative __reading__ 'lords' has been defended by reputable critics.
The recognition of greatness and nobility seems particularly valuable in the case of this tragedy because it is ignored in many modern __reading__s of the play.
There has been some very careless proof-__reading__ also, which weakens the authority of the printed text: for example, did George Eliot really think that Pope Adrian IV was originally named Nicholas Buakspear?
Designed for the college student or the adult reader, the courses emphasize careful __reading__ of three short novels and writing of short papers.
Sharon Cameron offers a detailed critical __reading__ of Dickinson's works, focusing in particular on ""time"" as a thematic and structural element; she also sets Dickinson's poems in a larger, more theoretical context by examining the poetics of the lyric as a genre.
Such estimations frequently stem from superficial __reading__s of the poetry and in- sufficient acquaintance with Puritan exegetical tradition.
The whole of Tarr's eighth note repre- sents a piece of rather unpleasant mis__reading__.
Such a proposal, like the attack upon the comprehensive, derives from the conviction, which most students have picked up from teachers nurtured on the ""New Criticism,"" that close __reading__ is the only re- spectable kind of __reading__, and it is better to know a tiny plot well than to have some familiarity with the whole terrain, to have felt one poem profoundly than to understand an author's pattern of development, to know one writer in depth than to have some acquaintance with several representatives of an age or tradition.
Articles in PMLA are also, of course, intended for future consultation, but the hope is that, unlike most scholarly articles, those appearing in PMLA -which have had up to nine favorable __reading__s before acceptance-are of such importance that they can be read by scholars with the same interest, if not fervor, that one brings to the __reading__ of an article in, say, Harper's or The New Yorker.
The section on Melchior Lechter offers exciting __reading__ as regards Stefan George's attitude to Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche and also to the problem of the 'Urerlebnis' in art: George considered Tristan und Isolde an extreme case: 'outrierte Reizkunst', inspired by 'echtes Gefiihl', but not fully an 'Urer- lebnis, das den ganzen Menschen bestimme'; 'bei Wagnerscher Musik habe ich mich ein bisschen geschamt'.
He has the advantages of wide __reading__ and careful erudition, and is at his best in tracing obscure influences, in unravelling intricate questions of authorship or authenticity, and in reconstructing patterns of thought and feeling in a poet or a whole period.
The implication seems to be that scholars would pass by if they could and a close __reading__ of the play tends to reinforce this impression.
Other notes are plainly wrong; while erroneous textual __reading__s and faulty punctuation distort the sense at a number of points, more than once through a failure to distinguish between indicative and subjunctive.
It would not serve, however, simply to see Bruno as Chapman's source, for while Chapman seems to invoke something like Bruno's philosophical __reading__ of the myth, he does so with the strong awareness that one could read the myth another way.
Apart from such outright errors in __reading__ the manuscripts, there are other instances in which Daalder adopts the less likely __reading__ of a doubtful paleographic form and fails to note the more likely __reading__.
The speaker of the first half is the foolish academic debater; the speaker of the second half a sophisticated literary man of wide __reading__ and fine sensibility.
If his merit is that of a close reader, he will show it by his sureness and subtlety in the close __reading__ of life; he must be familiar with its themes and symbols first.

There is the usual careful revision in dating and general commentary, and there are approximately a further one hundred and forty better __reading__s for the texts of already included letters.
Some __reading__s are better than others, and it is an impoverishment of the world to pretend otherwise .... there are many valid critical methods and there are thus many valid __reading__s of any literary work.
Drawing on his wide __reading__s in areas of Spanish literature generally neglected by contemporary readers and systematically assembling the findings of all important studies dealing with the various aspects of his subject (notably the work of Frank Pierce, Giovanni Maria Bertini, and Maxime Chevalier), Arce presents a lucid synthetic account which will stand as an impor- tant, if somewhat sketchy chapter in Spain's literary history.

Notwithstanding this, there is still a great deal of subsidiary explanatory matter within the text itself, set off in smaller type, which makes for uneasy __reading__.
The method of close __reading__ became the pedagogical weapon of the New Criticism.
To disregard the needs and powers of that rational consciousness is to deny a central element in the sermons and to risk serious mis__reading__.
But in his critical work Kermode actually offers a very persuasive description of Hawthorne's authorial action that constitutes a comprehensive __reading__ of the textual details.

Designed to present complete, authoritative, and highly interesting scientific __reading__ material for classes at the intermediate and advanced level.
Further, mere __reading__ is not an aesthetic experience either, just as merely looking at a statue is not an aesthetic experience of it; these are simply preliminary to that experience.
One should grant that the proliferation of ""explications"" became later a dreary industry, but it is a mistake to consider close __reading__ a new version of explication de texte.
Though she does not reject outright the hints of baptism and salvation that have been seen, for instance, in Beowulf's plunge into the monsters' lake, Mrs Goldsmith prefers to subordinate them to an overall __reading__ that gives a more human and strenuous role to the hero, that of the man exposed to and struggling against the temptations of temporalia, the corroding power of rule and of the dragon's treasure.
Musil would have liked the acclaim of a wider __reading__ public while he lived, although he wished for a position of financial independence before he started writing, a position like Ulrich's, the 'Mann ohne Eigenschaften', who did not care overmuch for the approval or disapproval of his fellows.
All the same, only a senti- mental __reading__ of the stories would maintain that he sanctions without qualification what, in their case, the grotesques' yearnings have produced: narrowness of vision, a refusal to grow, the wilful denial of experience-in short, their fanaticism.
An ample anthology of the best and most representative examples makes fascinating and pleasurable __reading__.
More disturbing yet, a close __reading__ of the dialogue suggests that in the world of James's late fiction, such ordinary human questions may finally prove unanswerable.
The reader is energetically involved in critical __reading__s of a very varied range of source material by his responses to both the many illuminating insights and the interpretations that he rejects.
Again, it is only by assuming what I would prove that the evidence becomes evi- dence, and indeed if we take as representative Frank Smith's definition of successful __reading__ as the reduction of uncertainty, then the re- searches of psycholinguistics would seem to offer more comfort to Rader and to Bush than to me.
'It is one thing to write with enjoyment on a sub- ject when the subject is hot in your mind from recent __reading__, coloured with recent prejudice; and it is quite another business to put these writings coldly forth again in a bound volume.
Mallarme's works exasperate this hopeless effect through their very structure, in that-wholly relational-nothing ever remains behind, even from the most exhaustive __reading__, from the most thoroughgoing familiarity.

Dr. Gaskell properly respects the authority of the manuscript as a check on both the 'substantive' or verbal __reading__s and the 'accidentals' of a printed copy-text, but despite magis- terial rulings to the contrary, he ordinarily prefers the first edition to the manu- script, for the reason that most authors relied on the printer to normalize the 'accidentals' of spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.
It may or may not be an accurate description of that act, but at least it attempts to describe a temporal __reading__ experience, a model differing radically from the spatial models of formalist criticism.

A close __reading__ reveals the con- sistent use of the Greco-Roman ethical-political conception of the state, epitomized in the figure of the ruler.
Because critical editions involve judgment, it is not un- likely that two careful scholars may disagree about certain __reading__s in a critical text; and it is certainly possible that two different texts of the same work could meet CSE standards and qual- ify for the emblem.
Strained and unbalanced __reading__s of this kind, and there are a good many of them, suggest to me that Dr. Garber-who can be both sensitive and perceptive when she is not trying to fit Shakespeare into her particular Procrustean bed-is to some extent the victim of her own thesis.
Implicit in his demand, then, is the assumption that a single __reading__ of the law, formulated by a single mediator, can, and in- deed must, suffice.
Clifton Cherpack reevaluates Paul et Virginie (""at a time when the Marquis de Sade receives all the plaudits, it is no mean accomplishment to rehabilitate Paul et Virginie""), and Robert Lougy gives a similarly provocative __reading__ of Vanity Fair as he looks into the warped looking glass, the vision that doesn't lend itself to satire.
Apart from such obvious mis__reading__s, the author begs question after question concerning the tone, mood, and meaning of the poems she deals with.
The second part consists of short __reading__s devoted to eight extended passages or verse-paragraphs.
The author investigates the all-important question of how medieval German sermons came to be set down on parchment and paper and reaches the conclusion that such sermons became the favourite __reading__-matter in pious lay circles and in nunneries, particularly the latter.
R's de after doner seems corrupt, but the frequency of the use in Anglo- Norman of de (as against a) between verb and dependent infinitive makes it a feasible __reading__.
Summaries and paraphrases of books and reviews are not easy to make attractive __reading__, and the stylistic problem posed by an attempt to explain how a writer's works relate to criticisms of his previous works may be illustrated by the following sentence: The other note was in response to criticism of the interpretation Arnold had placed on Renan's remarks concerning J. W. Donaldson's Latin treatise, Jashar, and Charles Forster's elaborate philosophy of history evolved from parallels to the little and great horns of the he-goat mentioned in Daniel.

The history of the reception of Stifter itself makes for fascinating __reading__.
It is still stiff __reading__, but well worth the reader's while to persevere.

The editor links this allegorical approach with the glossing technique which Marie de France extols in the Prologue to her Lais (he quotes the passage twice, from different editions): such glossing of non-religious texts ought not, I think, to be equated too readily with allegorical __reading__s of religious texts such as we are dealing with.
IV This representational __reading__ of a discursive or presentational theme which thus acquires the force of metaphor is supported by numerous lines of textual evidence; I deal here only with two of those lines, both of which are initiated in the opening scene.
The easy view of her development as a passage from subjectivity to objectivity will not survive an attentive __reading__ of this culminating episode.

A historian can't go on asserting and reasserting these diverse modes of evidence without making his book unreadable, so he does the best he can by citing such proofs only at strategic points in his exposition, in the hope that the reader will note and remember their relevance to everything that precedes and follows; even while, as an experienced historian, he knows full well that such a procedure places on the reader a responsibility for close __reading__ and total recall which he can't realistically expect the reader to fulfill.
Under the pen of Jansen or Quesnel 'the demon who torments the Gerasene is assimi- lated to concupiscence, to unchastity, to unrestrained sexual desire-an unwarranted __reading__ of the text, but by allegorical displacement one type of servitude is substituted for another.
Though I do not myself accept all of Professor Fitch's analyses, I am delighted to report that there is no nonsense in his book: his interpretations lie within that range of sensible, tasteful, possible, and intelligent __reading__s which make Shakespearian criticism and even Shakespearian disagreements both rewarding and pleasant.

Too often, given a choice between a plain and a fancy __reading__, Professor Harrold inclines toward the fancy.
Sr Alazraki in this new study of Borges's narrative prose adopts a third method - that of close textual __reading__ after the manner of Damaso Alonso although surprisingly after declaring that his intention is to study the relationship between 'significado' and 'significante', he does divide study of themes from his study of style, adjectivization, and figures of speech.
A sympathetic __reading__ of Antony and Cleopatra concludes this chapter.
This is a perfectly correct, in fact very perceptive, __reading__ of Johnson's narration, which does strongly imply, although it never explicitly makes, that equation.

); next, a premium on new '__reading__s', which multiplied and became ever more 'remote, ingenious, abstract, and decadent', and led to scepticism and boredom (and Mr. Hirsch goes so far as to declare 'the fashion of close __reading__ has run its course'); finally, a 'new approach' is demanded, so 'why not turn to politics and social action ?'
It also forms a distinct line of descent, all the other manuscripts being descended from a common ancestor (this conclusion is supported by the fact that in some instances C has correct __reading__s against all other manuscripts).

It is works, rather, which out of the potential stock of pro- duced works have been selected, propagated, and evaluated by social in- stitutions, according to ideological, aesthetic, economic, or other view- points, and whose road to the reader has additionally been cleared by meas- ures of the most varied sort (advertising, book production, reviews, com- mentary, discussions of the work, public __reading__s, literary prizes, populari- zation of the author, and so on).
We are briefly introduced, first, to 'Some aspects of comedy in Germany up to the seventeenth century', after which comes an essay in Professor Powell's finest, most perceptive style on 'Society and literature in seventeenth-century Germany', a mere six pages which should be made essential __reading__ for anyone approaching this complex period.
In placing the texts within their literary and historical contexts, she provides a literary history of romance as genre, a fresh __reading__ of individual poems, and an exploration of the continuing romance of figurative language itself.
Leaving aside the more general question of binary oppositions and their validity, this attribution to Todorov of poetic __reading__/allegorical __reading__ as mutually exclu- sive shows Lem's own mis__reading__: Todorov does not oppose them (as a structuralist he could not), but unites them as both killing the ""pure Fantas- tic"" in his definition (see below).
To speak of the ""deconstructive"" __reading__ of a poem as ""parasitical"" on the ""obvious or univocal __reading__"" is to enter, perhaps unwittingly, into the strange logic of the parasite, to make the univocal equivocal in spite of oneself, according to the law that language is not an instrument or tool in man's hands, a submissive means of thinking.

Significant introductory __reading__ for students of Old English literature.
Dr Pearsall evidently has a wide knowledge of medieval literature, both Latin and vernacular, but he wears his learning lightly, and the result is that for once a work on, it must be admitted, a generally dull and far too diffuse poet, is anything but dull itself; on the contrary it makes interesting and stimulating __reading__.
This then, is a book for those who are already familiar with the particular quality of Renan's thought from a broad __reading__ of his works in their full form, who are thus in a position to recognize the significance that subjects such as Greece or Israel have within the overall structure, and who will therefore perhaps find this grouping under themes useful for reference; but as an introduction to, or as an attempt to extract the essence of Renan's undoubted wisdom, this anthology can only foster the long-standing cliche of Renan the dilettante, which Professor Peyre declares it is in some measure his aim to remove from our minds.
Suvin's wide __reading__ and keen critical intelligence illuminate every subject he considers.

Michael Seidel's book is of more limited interest and opens fewer interpretative possibilities, but his close examination of Victor Berard's Les Pheniciens et l'Odyssee and Samuel Butler's The Authoress of the Odyssey does throw some interesting light on Ulysses as well as offering a helpful __reading__ of the Odyssey.

In assessing the total value of the work, quarrels over theories perhaps matter less than demonstrable proofs of error-the carelessness which fails to note an emendation, or to make one which is clearly required; the faulty proof-__reading__ which leaves untold mistakes in an old-spelling text; the reliance upon Greg's not infallible Parallel Texts edition of Dr. Faustus.
To make us all the more uncomfortable, the play, even when taken strictly as comedy, comes dangerously close to being two plays rather than one; and a careless __reading__ or an insensitive performance may invite us to give a divided re- sponse, at least throughout much of the middle part.

The monograph is based on an admirably close examination of Chretien's text, though it is tiresome to find that all quotations (with the exception of the Perceval) are drawn from the CFMA editions (the presumed superiority of which is never justified), the more so since the author is frequently obliged to adduce (superior) __reading__s from Foerster's texts.

In formalist analyses the only constraints are the notoriously open-ended possibilities and combination of possibilities that emerge when one begins to consult dictionaries and grammars and his- tories; to consult dictionaries, grammars, and histories is to assume that meanings can be specified independently of the activity of __reading__; what the example of ""spare"" shows is that it is in and by that activity that meanings-experiential, not positivist-are created.

One final remark: the goal of the reconstruction of styles of __reading__ through the study of the interpretations of individual works is not to apprehend how a given scholar read concretely, e.g., how Spitzer read Racinian tragedy in his masterful interpretation, ""Le Recit de Theramene""; what imports is the account of the general properties of __reading__ specific to a given literary culture or even a given period.

Mr. Wimsatt's painstaking report of his __reading__ offers material for a more significant study; that of the 'grammar of motives', large and small, that was available to medieval European poets, which in part stretches back to earliest antiquity and which continued at least till the seventeenth century, a changing yet seamless linguistic fabric in several lan- guages, from which great poets cut their own patterns.

It is scarcely plausible that any of them are either __reading__ or writing.
The reader of 'L'Orange' has been told of the fruit's aspirations, of how poorly it resists the ordeal of expression and oppression, and of its passiveness; and now, __reading__ that the skin of the orange is 'juste assez rugueux pour accrocher dignement la lumiere sur la parfaite forme du fruit', he is forced to reflect on man's expression and activeness, and on man as introducing dignity and measure into the world by structuring it in resistance.
We see Lewis, a very young man in Paris, attending the anti-monastic drama of the Revolution, and, perhaps, __reading__ Sade's Justine, and are reminded that his ferocious dreams of sexual possession and domination by force, however crude, are to be taken seriously, and fume from an interior abyss more important than German legends.
Studies referred to in the text are few, and it would surely have been useful to have provided a guide to some of the better Gracian criticism, and perhaps sug- gestions for further __reading__ on topics discussed; for example, Professor Kassier deals extensively with 'al revesismo', but does not mention Helen Grant's helpful studies of the phenomenon in Spain."

He does not however raise the question of why Leon's choice of oracle should fall on the Cumaean Sibyl in particular, though it is an interesting one, and it is our purpose to show that the choice of the Cumaean Sibyl is not arbitrary but deliberate and significant, and that what we will call the sibyl episode and its genesis are a great deal more closely woven into the fabric of La Modification than a first __reading__ (even a careful one) would indicate.
For the fact that there is a second __reading__ marks the interior story a first __reading__-that is to say, marks it a ""__reading__"" rather than a stable text.

The ambiguity of the mirror structure of the story (the second part on a linear, 'denotative' level is either a continuation from the first, or a dream-repetition of it: 'connotative' level) allows a tension between two __reading__s of Dahlman's death either as a failure of spirituality and culture in Argen- tina, or as a vision of himself in the heroic mirror of the Argentine archetype of the gaucho knife-fight, nostalgically held by Borges to be the deepest aspiration of all patriots.
I felt all these as I went along on my first __reading__.
For what promises to be a dramatic climax turns out to be a philosophical discourse so obscure that on first __reading__ we really are not quite sure what Marcel (in contrast to Marlow and Raskolnikov) has actually learned.
My purpose now is to ask about the kinds of suggestion and deception practised in the opening page of The Good Soldier, in contrast to the others we looked at earlier; and to ask what they imply about ""second __reading__s"" and the activity required of the reader.
His scene-by-scene analysis of the multiple characters in their multiple plots is worth a dozen re__reading__s for its brilliant understanding of Jonson's techniques, but so absorbed is Levin in these objects and their representation that he can finally see only ""the network of these connections"" as constituting ""the organizing principle of the entire play.""
We are all, according to him, one life, whether we realize it or not-indeed, on one __reading__ at least of 'The Ancient Mariner', initiation into a sense of the 'one Life' is a condition of love, rather than the other way round.
Such a claim would require that a second __reading__ be considered a second independent experiencing and that each experiencing of a processual poem is richer than each experiencing of a written one.

Interpretation as the con- cretization of a specific significance (among other possible signifi- cances which earlier interpreters have concretized or later interpret- ers can still concretize) always remains bound to the horizon of the first __reading__, perceiving aesthetically and understanding with plea- sure; it next has the task of illuminating the verbal and poetic condi- tions which, from the construction of the text, orient the primary act of understanding.

The letter and the tableau make sense only together, in a comparative __reading__, and there would be nothing to dictate such a __reading__ if it were not for the undecidability of bons a tirer and for ungrammaticalities that corroborate the effect of the syllepsis on the reader and further insure that he will read the two texts together and interpret them as two variants of one invariant.

Dr Took develops this idea against the background of the rhetorical tradition known to Dante and his contemporaries, and illustrates his argument with close __reading__s of a number of representative poems, but, informative and thought-provoking though this chapter is, it remains in some ways the least satisfactory in the book.
For once we acknowledge that the plays of Shakespeare and his fellow dramatists were written for the stage, then it necessarily follows that any interpretation of them that cannot be conveyed on the stage could not have been intended by the author and so must be rejected (that is, if we are attempting to interpret the author's intended meaning, which is the claim of those thematic and ironic __reading__s).

One can readily applaud Professor Oliver's principle of refusing to indulge in the usual number of metrical emendations on the reasonable grounds that Shakespeare did not always write ten syllables to a line and that editors have no right to impose that straitjacket on him, but there are still several instances where the addition or omission of a monosyllabic word seems necessary to the sense as well as the metre of a line, and this repudiation of editorial tradition produces some very awkward __reading__s.

However, her close and perceptive __reading__ of the novel does make the valid point that Ibo society of the late nineteenth century had a centre grounded in a cosmic order; and that the communal harmony was threatened, and indeed disrupted, by forces operative within that society, no less than by external pressures from the incursion of missionary and commercial enterprises.

Mr Sturrock's lucid elaboration of structuralist methods of analysis and his meticulous respect for textual relevance produce some excellent __reading__s, for instance of 'La muerte y la brujula' or 'Guayaquil' or 'Pierre Menard'; the inner grammar of Borges's composition becomes revealed in ways which must modify and enrich one's __reading__.
The volume as a whole, however, like Professor Stern's own eloquent and surely definitive __reading__ of 'Josefine oder das Volk der Mause' which concludes it, does much to open up Kafka's work.
I mention these public __reading__s for a number of reasons.
In the process, she claims neither de- finitiveness nor structural completeness for her different __reading__s and __reading__ systems, but only their usefulness in recognizing the particular achievements of woman-as-author and their applicability in conscientiously decoding woman-as-sign.
The combination of erudition and sensitive __reading__ which charac- terizes the book as a whole is shown here to its best advantage.
Again the inconsistency is obvious enough: any attentive __reading__ of the text at the proof stage would have picked it up.
Yet hermeneutic __reading__s are undermined by the fact that they compensate for the supplementarity of writing by substituting for it what we can fairly call the supplement of __reading__: in other words, the signifier, writing, which stood in place of an absent signified, is now replaced by __reading__, which stands in place of writing.
This is a sober - even austere - but elegantly-written study which potential readers should approach only with a wide preparatory __reading__ of the New Criticism.
The real meaning, again by definition, is not related to this structure; in fact it can only be discovered by deliberately ""dislocating"" the structure and digging out scattered hints that were concealed by the author (to fool the fools), and that, even when brought together by the critic's ""close __reading__,"" do not produce a coherent sequence, either temporal or logical, or add up to anything we could recognize as a unified artistic whole.
The physical film makes their con- structions easy or hard, and they try new __reading__s of the film or abide by the old ones accordingly.
But this interaction, as we have seen in the case of Biographia Literaria, is much more complicated than a hermeneutic __reading__ will allow.
One of the most striking aspects of Sherwin's study is his ability to provide close and sensitive __reading__s of difficult (and often neglected) texts, and yet there are occasional disappointments here as well.
After a brief introduction to the cantigas de amigo, Sr Ferreira draws far-reaching conclusions from a new __reading__ of the texts concerning the seguir, a genre in which a pre-existent text forms the basis for a new composition.
A Cultural Approach to Beginning Spanish Second Edition Eduardo Neale-Silva / Robert L. Nicholas Provides more extensive introductory activities, consolidates key grammatical explana- tions, ties many exercises to attractive photographs and realia, presents new exercises for conversation and writing, and introduces several new __reading__s and dialogues.
For those of us who are moderately fluent in the language this provides an easy and pleasant __reading__ of Beowulf.
It is Sallie Sears's view that ""A careful __reading__ of the ending .
Both Miller's and Soyinka's addresses are, in their respective spheres, political texts that bear scrupulous __reading__.
For such a course this collection of essays would be essential __reading__.
Noel Thomas, with the clarity and sanity that characterized his book on Grass, offers an admirable __reading__ of the ambiguities of Die Blechtrommel.
I have chosen to display the doubleness of the referen- tial code by the two columns of commentary: the left column is endoxal, consisting of German proverbs without which a full __reading__ of the text is impossible and on which the story itself is an oblique commentary; the right column is my individual response, the personal references evoked in a single reader's attempt to read the text.
The lines have to be read metaphorically within the metaphor constituted by the whole poem, but even taken at face value they might caution us against reductive __reading__.
I will not even attempt anything like a complete __reading__ of the Three Essays.
Four of the other agree- ments would seem to be in authoritative __reading__s not likely to have been arrived at by coincidence (nos.
- disposed across the middle of the page, the author's own lion-share dialogue with texts/documents/method: the whole being a highly suggestive, totally idiosyncratic typographical presentation of thoughts; thoughts within thoughts; doubts/blanks/ silences; certainties; hesitations/blanks/silences, all making up a complex inter- weave of horizontal __reading__s, vertical __reading__s, parallel __reading__s.
How much of a revelation the reader will experience must depend on his previous knowledge and understanding, but the sections on action and interaction are written con amore and make good __reading__.
Progressing from Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi through the recent fictions of Italo Calvino and Umberto Eco, Lucente writes a history of narrative self- consciousness over the course of two centuries and offers detailed __reading__s of texts of Verga, D'Annunzio, Pirandello, Silone, Lampedusa, Morante, and others.
These Memoirs of a War Correspondent, later published in two volumes, still make good __reading__ and incidentally demonstrate Molnar's deep humanity, a trait that critics often find lacking in his plays.
In this way, Literary Love is not only a valuable contribution to the history of an idea but also a particularly helpful education in critical __reading__.
The hermeneutic __reading__, I would suggest, might begin by taking notice of T. E. Hulme's crude but effective principle, and looking at Jameson's conclusions.
If this critic is concerned with the influence that a text can have on the reader, he or she must be concerned as much with, and aware of, the influence of an inaccurate __reading__ as of an accurate one.
Similarly, it is hard to believe that Dmitri Shostakovich's party-line justifications of his Fifth and Seventh Symphonies (or the subversive intent he later claimed for them) really shaped the music; these symphonies have too much integrity I would like to thank Martin Bresnick, Barney Childs, B. J. Foreman, and Jann Pasler for careful critical __reading__s of earlier versions of this article and for several helpful suggestions.
Mr Ide's often acute __reading__s of these plays point to a dislocation of the heroic ideal, emphasized by the mixed nature of the genre of heroic tragedy, which mingles praise and reprehension.
What I'm doing, in fact (I would claim), is following Byron's strong mis__reading__ of the play in Manfred, where the hero calls on Lear's apocalyptic rhetoric from the ""Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks"" speech to lament the loss not of a daughter but of a sister: To be thus- Grey-hair'd with anguish, like these blasted pines, Wrecks of a single winter, barkless, branchless, A blighted trunk upon a cursed root, Which but supplies a feeling to decay- And to be thus, eternally but thus, Having been otherwise!
In any case, I never argued that the moral __reading__ was inadmissible.
But in the light of Dr Hermans's excellent __reading__s of Apollinaire's 'Zone' and 'Les Fenetres' and parts of Le Comet a des, and also in view of his judicious reappraisal of the use of colours in Trakl's poetry, more detailed practical illustration of certain general findings would have been welcome.
Its exploitation of untranslatable terms and nuances (a case in point is 'die aufzuhebende Negation'), the dialectical movement of the material, and the accommodation of a fundamental Rezeptions- isthetik combine with a painstaking __reading__ of primary texts (when it comes to that!)
proves more short than waste or ruining""- and this line, too, introduces a problem with the usual __reading__; for if ""our ever-living poet"" refers to Shakespeare, the promised ""eternity"" makes dubi- ous sense.
In detailed __reading__s of four novels with dramatized narrators-Thackeray's Vanity Fair, Conrad's Chance, Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time, and John Fowles's French Lieutenant's Woman-Siegle juxtaposes the representational assumption that narrative is taken from ""actuality"" against the constitutive insistence that discourse creates fictive worlds in which the reader may feel at home.
I say 'if' because his close scrutiny of the texts produces reflexions which do not always make for easy __reading__.
The organization of the book is successful and concludes with a useful __reading__-list.
It is well produced, with apparently impeccable proof-__reading__ (as far as the present reviewer can judge), and reasonably legible print, although the Maya hieroglyphs and such scripts as Tibetan, Nepali, or Kanarese can be appreciated only in general terms.
It might be said that Professor Witermeyer (to hold briefly to the more literal __reading__) has provided a 'descriptive catalogue' of the gallery-canvases both displayed and stored.
In a series of acute __reading__s, Marshall reveals the centrality of the notion of sympathy for major eighteenth-century texts.
Though O'Connor's critical __reading__s have the limitations of their own methodology, this study is extremely useful as a piece of research and for its resultant insights into the connection between Rhys's life and writing 'that unite the experi- ences of the child, the woman, and the colonial in one voice'.
The traditional __reading__, he argues, is inconsistent with Dante's use of allegory elsewhere in the poem, as well as with the theoretical statements of the letter to Can Grande; it causes the episode to appear illogical within the structure of the Commedia as a whole, since the poem contains no equivalent treatment of any of the other sacraments, not even the most important of them, the Eucharist.
An analysis of the overall design pattern and the interrelation of form and content reveals why the efforts of the past have been un- successful in interpreting the monument's inscrip- tion and leads to the development of a new __reading__.
Mr Black defines his approach to Lawrence as a New-Critical 'close __reading__' technique which does not, however, preclude the possibility of relating a given text to any other text, provided there are palpable affinities between them.
To explore the means by which Bergman achieves this goal, the book offers extended close __reading__s of several of his films.
Finally there are those essays which involve close __reading__s of Lorca's work.
Of these, Rowe's 'flame-coloured' was for long the most popular __reading__, although more recent ed- itions appear to be replacing it with Collier's 'dun-coloured' (and the change may be in itself an interesting reflection of our whole altered sense of the play.
In reminding us in his conclusion that Renaissance theorists were effectively establishing a code in which to describe the act of translation, Glyn Norton alerts us to the central problem of his own study: how to impose a systematic __reading__ upon a subject whose treatment apparently admitted an amorphous mass of descriptive terminology, much of which initially seems commonplace.
This leads to yet another area of disagreement: the traditional no- tion of ""wrong __reading__"" is opposed by the deconstructive notion of ""mis__reading__"" or ""misprision.""
It is inevitable that if one wishes to engage in historicist __reading__s of texts this kind of approach will loom large, since in establishing the possible ranges of bygone meaning the reader's response will be about as important as the author's intention.
(Dr Coustillas comments on the 'frankness' of the entries per- taining to Gissing's personal relations; less oddly he says that they make 'tepid' __reading__ today.)
So I shall just touch on four of our contrasting __reading__s and then turn to the more important matter of how we view ethical criticism.
He demands close __reading__, as in his chapter entitled 'The Evolution of Dickens's Style and Method within Martin Chuzzlewit'; a critical awareness of conflicting opinions; and an attention comprehensive enough to include chapter headings, illustrations, prefaces, and textual variations.
For those experienced in such 'naive' __reading__, traditional tales, though not 'like life', express 'what life is like', their improbable events reflecting in symbolic form our deeper, less conscious feelings about human experience.
(Dr Coustillas comments on the 'frankness' of the entries per- taining to Gissing's personal relations; less oddly he says that they make 'tepid' __reading__ today.)
In its most efficacious and legitimate aspect, this critical __reading__ of the history (and) of genre-theory is based on an opposition between nature and history and, more generally-as the allusion to an artificial construct indicates ("".
Yet there are serious draw- backs to the standard critical __reading__ which interprets Gothic sub- limity as merely instrumental, something to be used, a repertoire of terrifying devices.
Notes to the essays and selected bibliographies suggest additional __reading__.
If, as someone has said, the true justification for a sophisticated critical edition is to pass on its findings to the general reader in the form of an improved __reading__ edition after a due lapse of time, we shall have a long time to wait.
If they [Baldung's contemporaries] had initially supposed that St Anne was fondling Christ's penis, they would surely have looked again to see if another, less wildly inappropriate __reading__ was possible.
Mr Minnis has done Chaucerians a great service by assembling this body of material and presenting it in so cogent a fashion, and he frees others to follow or diverge from his particular __reading__s, but within boundaries that he has now authoritatively established.
The historic __reading__ and the theoretical interpretation of the iconic text must therefore take place at the zone of articulation between those two schemes, with special focus on the historical figures of this articulation where the iconic text, as previously suggested, mirrors itself showing the repre- sentations.
Essential new __reading__ for all Johnsonians.
Shelley: A Voice Not Understood is a lucid, intelligent, and well-argued exposition of Shelley's ideas, as they are to be discovered in close __reading__ of his poetry and his prose pamphlets and fragments.
At the same time that Newman is drawing his self-portrait by 'novelistic means', such as detailing his early __reading__ to give his character, he is also presenting a meticulously dated and documented chronology.
A necessarily business-like __reading__ turned up some forty or so of these, ranging from spelling mistakes to irritating errors of syntax and expression.
Even though some of us may not yet feel comfortable with Harold Bloom's antithetical __reading__s of a poem's satanic impulses, we still recognize such __reading__s as a familiar critical gesture.
The book is full of close and thoughtful __reading__s.
Her early __reading__ was Treasure Island, Huckleberry Finn, and The Count of Monte Cristo-later Kipling was one of her heroes-and she sought to express her own creative urges by denying her femininity.
Yet, at the same time, Celos aun del aire matan is relatively free from strong emblematic pointers, much as Gongora's poetic treatment of Ovid and Rubens's pictorial treatment of episodes from the Metamorphoses resist emblematic __reading__.
No genuinely intelligent close-__reading__ of a text can be without interest or value.
In either case, even in declamatory or incantatory __reading__, the rhythms of natural speech cannot be abrogated.
It is a strategic error of some magnitude that the author did not decide to organize her argument thematically, but conducted it, in the case of each of the five romances, according to the course of the narrative plot, for this involves her in a large measure of recapitulation of content and makes for rather unexciting __reading__ with no real intellectual challenge.
Faced with the inevitable and unenviable task of selection, Mr Wilson has tended to under-represent the later Paz of the Vuelta collection; in a short paragraph on 'A la mitad de esta frase' he offers an uncharac- teristically incomplete __reading__ of a poem which illustrates as pointedly as any other by Paz his conception of history as a 'juego que nadie gana, | juego sin reglas, | desvario de un dios especulativo'.
'The Fall of the House of Usher', in a bold __reading__, becomes the most Southern of Poe's tales, despite its lack of location-the house as crumbling mansion, Roderick as the enervated scion of an aristocratic line, Madeline as the sister with whom he forms an incestuous rela- tionship.
Max Wehrli's survey is the distillation of a lifetime's experience of teaching medieval literature and is clearly the fruit of wide __reading__ and reflection.
Many of the standard devotional and didactic treatises were plainly designed for private __reading__, and in fact any lengthy volume-an uncharted outcome of the print revolution-required individual, usually solitary, contemplation.
In opting not for initial but for subsequent __reading__s as the valid test and therefore the occasions for informed critical judgment, Johnson dos not deny the reality or even the significance of first impressions.
Building on that idea, Paul Alkon has presented a more complex __reading__ of Defoe's treatment of time than appears in Blewett's book, but his __reading__ of what he considers to be Defoe's best novel is still very good.
If this were the case with L'Exil et le Royaume, one might reach a 'satisfactory' __reading__ of'La Femme adultere', for example, in psychological terms as a conflict between a desire for independence and its concomitant sense of guilt.
Doskow's study reveals a thorough __reading__ of recent Jerusalem commentary, but research into the political, religious, and literary context from which the poem emerged is not apparent.
Brilliantly executed as it is, Empson's attempt to undermine the politely sanctimonious __reading__ of the Father's tyrannical ""ukase"" has not prevented most of the critics writing after him from identifying, im- plicitly, with the loyal angels.

This pointilliste approach makes difficult __reading__.
Homans is critically sensitive and psychologically acute; at the least this book offers stimulating __reading__s of the three women's work.
Thus, one might contrast the law, where interpretive practice is such that it de- mands a single __reading__ (verdict), with the practice of literary criticism, where the pressure is for multiple __reading__s (so much so that a text for which only one __reading__ seemed available would be in danger of losing the designation ""literary"").
While the avant-garde of criticism heads for deconstruction at an increasing rate, the consensus method of interleaving close __reading__ and the description of biographical/intellectual development to arrive at ajudgement of an author's worth continues to be productive at a number of levels.
Indeed the one criticism I have of his work is that his actual __reading__s of Pound's poetry are rather too naive.
Is there nothing behind J. C. Shairp's charge of 'exclusiveness', R. H. Hutton's doubts about Arnold's selective __reading__ of the Bible, or Leslie Stephen's strictures on Arnold's imbalanced pleas to dissenters?
Similarly, to give our hypotheses and assumptions a just trial, we must show a degree of persistence in defending them against opposing __reading__s and rival ap- proaches.
In the poem Johnson distinguishes, as he so often does in his criticism, between initial __reading__ of a work and subsequent __reading__s.
Just as neoclas- sical forms of knowledge and judgment involve an intelligent, ra- tional appraisal of relations among ideas, so a proper __reading__ of Congreve's masterpiece requires us to conceive character as a method of dramatizing and exploring the various positions that men (more especially women in this play) may adopt-wittingly or unwittingly-in the face of the overwhelming and general facts about human experience Congreve confronts us with.
The problem is seeing how a new __reading__ of the novel emerges from such knowledge.
By contrast the other contributors carry their learning with greater seriousness, but each reveals the rewards of a close __reading__ of the texts and thereby illuminates through a concern with the finer details of Joyce's style(s) the portrait of Joyce as creator which Brivic's study defines in generalized and largely theoretical terms.
Its basic units are not people and individual __reading__s, but large massive blocks: the public, society's __reading__ rituals, __reading__ systems and styles.
Thus theory and practice are once again considered dialectically: ""The very process of deciding between rival possible __reading__s is in need of examination.
We may conclude that Pound's critical __reading__s of the historical documents and his resulting depiction of Malatesta exemplify Hayden White's obser- vations concerning the inevitably interpretive, constructive, and ideological aspects of historio- graphy.
Berger wants to convince us that this kind of __reading__ is called for (""privileged"") by the very nature of Shakespeare's text (or his ""inherent textuality""), as may be seen in the way he contrasts the ""stage-centered __reading__"" and the ""text-centered __reading__.""
However, W. W. Greg says, ""It may happen that in a critical edition the text rightly chosen as copy may not by any means be the one that supplies most substantive __reading__s in cases of varia- tion.
These analytic, ostentatiously non-figurative notations take on greater impact with a parallel __reading__ of the 'artistic' version: BP - apercevoir les deux clochers de Martinville .. .
They serve somewhat more met- aphorically, but with comparable frequency, to explain the processing of larger units of discourse (the __reading__ of an entire work, for instance), such as when the move from an initial __reading__ to a subse- quent, more satisfactory understanding is said to involve recognizing subtler or more comprehensive textual codes, or when the entire act of __reading__ is considered a kind of decoding process.
Both Sheldon Brivic and Beryl Schlossman advocate a sacramental __reading__ of his works.
Each medium has its own properties, for better and worse usage, and intelligent film viewing and criticism, like intelligent __reading__, needs to understand and respect both the limitations these create and also the triumphs they invite.
Similarly, the polyphony of discourse antici- pates Jacques Derrida's concepts of excess and sup- plementarity, which also undermine the single, authoritative __reading__ or message.'
There is only one point when one might question her judgement: her apparent willingness to accept some of Edmund Wilson's excessively imaginative 'symbolic' __reading__s of the novel Doktor Zhivago.
I believe that from his earliest __reading__ of Joyce he saw that what Joyce was doing was of great importance for an American writer (a point I shall return to later) and with full delib- eration chose him as a source for his own writing.

Although the latter essay presents a rather schematic __reading__, it suggests a fruitful approach to Chaucer's complexities.

This truism is illustrated by one of the most persuasive sections of the book-the 'admonitory __reading__ of Astrophil and Stella' which, it is suggested, may be intended to draw the reader into the kind of self-examination advocated by Calvin in his commentaries on the Psalms.
It is a question, then, of what the individual reader chooses to notice or to ignore at the time of __reading__, and this idea raises the specter of a multiplicity of unchallengeable __reading__s and the end of our discipline as we have known it.
We should treat these cantos as Pound's at- tempt at history, then; but we should not be too eager to dismiss them-to assume that Pound's Malatesta, insofar as he differs from Burckhardt's or even from the more sympathetic Yriarte's, is a distortion, the result of Pound's hasty, careless, or prejudiced __reading__ of ill-chosen sources.
There is a persuasive progression from the apologia for The Grass is Singing as a 'statement of emotional anarchy' contained by tragic form, through the Bildungsroman analysis of Martha Quest towards the unavoidably post-modernist __reading__ of The Golden Notebook and the dynamic interplay of order and chaos.
We are forced back to the apparently less probable __reading__ that the angel must be taken at face value.
An eye for this carnival sense of the comic and for John Bayley's version of 'pastoral' ('what is ""framed"", ""characteristic"" or ""proffered""') also helps to produce flexible __reading__s of Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time, L. P. Hartley's The Go-Between, and Iris Murdoch's Henry and Cato.

It appears, therefore, that the key words used to defend the __reading__ peow support the other __reading__ instead.
This is especially so in ambiguous cases where a line may support more than one defensible __reading__.
Nevertheless this book is fascinating and strenuous __reading__, even when you are sure you are being led into a blind alley or up a garden path.
It makes for exciting, albeit taxing, __reading__.

Ponge the 'scripteur' all but eclipses the poet who considers himself 'l'ambassadeur du monde muet', and Greene has a strong tendency, mitigated by good __reading__s of 'Fable' and 'Le Pre', to reduce Ponge to what he may have in common with Mar- celin Pleynet.
""Consistently interesting and often brilliant __reading__s of some of Dickin- son's thorniest and more frequently explicated texts.""-Choice.

A similarly positive __reading__ had been proposed by Bowra some ten years before Morris had challenged Vivanco.
As a result, the task of seeingjust how far some theoretical treatment will take us in science has much in common with the task that Ronald Dworkin described here in the law: the problem will often be to discover just how far a particular representation of light as, for example, particulate in nature can be taken in the interest of explaining the phenomena of optics, or just how far a particular __reading__ of, for example, the con- stitutional theory of ""protected speech"" can be taken in the interest of protecting political demonstrators.

Ingram ('Fifteen Seventy-Nine and the Decline of Civic Religious Drama in Coventry') and David Bergeron's use of social history in the service of literary criticism ('Urban Pastoralism in English Civic Pageants').
This is also an intensely personal __reading__ of Cervantes.
Holy Theatre is lively __reading__.
""Deleuze's book offers an extremely rich and systematic __reading__ of Nietzsche.... To read Nietzsche and Philosophy is to experience the earnestness of Nietzsche's challenge to western philosophy.

A literal-minded __reading__ of Yeats's myth of the afterlife would, of course, annul the impor- tance of death in any of these forms, but it would also be incapa- ble of explaining his lyrics' more ambivalent representation of death as an occasion for courage.
The scholar persuaded by Professor Todd's methodology will be delighted by his book's breadth, boldness, and sheer agility, and even the unbeliever will find much to impress him in these subtle and persuasive __reading__s of three Russian literary masterpieces."
1980,article,187,0.22,5.347593582887701,"More concretely, I offer a __reading__ anchored in two related notions, repetition and excess, for in and through them the work discloses its hermeneutic complexity.
But my __reading__ allows for literary play, for an adaptation of a syllogism, and for a virtuoso liter- ary performance worthy of Chaucer's genius.
What is betrayed here is the book's least satisfactory quality, an uncertainty in the __reading__ of individual hymns.
I do not want here to test the validity of such a __reading__ against the text of Tartuffe as a whole.
At an earlier stage in my __reading__, before chancing upon Berthoff s reference to the Spenser passage, I was becoming more and more convinced, the deeper I went into the Marvell criticism, that the image of ""the iron gates of life,"" however improbable, had to allow a simpler, more straightforward explanation than those that were being offered by the experts.

As one moves from the first to the fourth stage, from St. Luke's to St. John's gospel, one has moved from the quill of the scriptor and its manuscript scroll to the ""__reading__"" index finger and printed book, but also from past history, from the inscription of the religious text, to the present of its __reading__ (as represented).
More serious are the mis__reading__s of Mann's admittedly difficult hand.
In this new compact paperbound 'Stu- dienausgabe' are at least the texts with which they might begin their __reading__; easy to use, it gives (albeit with numerous misprints) the text of nine of the major novels (Die Chronik der Sperlingsgasse, Horacker, Das Horn von Wanza, Pfisters Miihle, Unruhige Gaste, Im alten Eisen, Das Odfeld, StopJkuchen, and Die Akten des Vogelsangs), each with a scholarly introduction and 'Forschungsbericht', together with 'Wort-und Sacherklarungen', a select bibliography, and, where appropriate, a 'Bildanhang'.

In other words, it turns out that in its com- plexity, Poe's story invites a __reading__ that sees it as both a manifesta- tion of the discourse of power of the new disciplinary society, about which Foucault wrote so illuminatingly, and a text that puts the dis- cursive practices of that society on display.
In view of the continuing 'creationist' resistance in the United States and elsewhere this statement may be seen as something of an exaggeration, yet, as Professor Harding shows, Coleridge, who was early acquainted with the German writers on these subjects, indeed foresaw the coming difficulties for those whose Christianity was based on a __reading__ of the Bible as literally the word of God, dictated to a passive human instrument.
"" The ontological ambiva- lence Carton describes would find its origins, in my __reading__ of this scene, within the author's regressive desires fused with a verbal ambition that strives for reunion with the ""mother,"" with the already violated yet forever inviolate woman and the fatal im- plications of the father's heretofore public recognition of and affection for his daugh- ter.

Bethel, like many other commentators, it would appear, was unwilling to allow his __reading__ of Dante and Chaucer to stand idle, and he manufactured from his knowledge of the two poets and his neglect or ignorance of almost everything else a large number of 'influences' which are for the most part no more than casual verbal parallels or broad resemblances in the expression of commonplace medieval ideas.
Perhaps the most fascinating consequence of such a __reading__ is that it identifies Poe's hero as a fetishist who denies culturally affirmed sexual difference - a possibility that opens up a whole new approach both to the political question of ""restoration"" and to the mass appeal of the detective story genre, which the Dupin stories inaugurated in modern times.
A glossary of rhetorical terms, a thematic index to the __reading__s, and an author/title/rhetorical terms index are also provided.

Nevertheless, the __reading__s offered even those (like the treatment of Wilhelm Tischbeins Idyllen) which are little more than Nacherzdhlungen - are valuable to the extent that they provide a logically consistent description of a number of works, selected and conveniently grouped together on the basis of a persuasive theory: namely, that they all display a cyclical pattern.
It would be impossible to carry out, in the remainder of this essay, an alternative __reading__ of The Golden Bowl; instead of such a __reading__, a few observations leading to the initial framework of moral philos- ophy in James will be presented here.
It is equally falsifying to assume that a __reading__ could be totally subjective or more subjective than another __reading__, as the question does.

In other words we are asked to break the hermeneutic circle at the level of the oeuvre, and after grasping the essence of the canon through the spirit of its author, we are asked to reread the individual work in the light of the canon, projecting onto it a set of meanings that it does not have in isolation, and perhaps even reversing the __reading__ that emerges when the text is made its own context.

Conversely, the __reading__ process, dependent on the deciphering of the written symbols, results, on the one hand, in translating what is more specifically literary in a text (its scriptural characteristics), and on the other, in creating anew, in the readers' minds, all the planes which existed in the writer but were abolished by the writing process: the planes of preconscious and unconscious representation and their related fantasies.

The remaining study of Hauptmann's Einsame Menschen and Ulrika Woerner's Vor- friihling by Naomi Stephan raises but fails to exploit interesting questions about the problems of reception for a woman dramatist in Wilhelmine Germany; her criticism of Hauptmann's presentation of Johann and Anna, and her attribution of his success (as against Woerner's) to the way in which he allegedly pandered to contemporary paternalist prejudices, are rather odd in relation to this author, and seem based on a mis__reading__ of the play.

More serious are the mis__reading__s of Mann's admittedly difficult hand.

A last, really baffling point: in describing the passage from Gilbert's ""American Sexual Poetics"" we mentioned above, Lentricchia seems to make completely bizarre assumptions out of what looks like a disturbing impulse to treat the __reading__ of a critical essay as an opportunity to project himself into a Thematic Apperception Test.

Now, what does Leiris mean by the ""horn of the bull,"" a figure that de Man borrows both to designate and to implicitly date the ""referential __reading__-moment"" he has in mind as what ""political and autobiographical texts have in common""-their common reference to a moment of historical reality--""no matter how deluded this moment may be"" in its __reading__ by others and/or in its __reading__ by itself, in its own self-presentation and self-perception?

Writing of the latter, for instance, Dr Tichi's approach produces a __reading__ of Cooper's The Pioneers which shifts attention away from the mythic vision of Natty Bumppo to Judge Temple's social vision and locates the potential tragedy in Cooper's own uncertainty that reform of the landscape can be implemented in a democracy.
If my __reading__ of the Bellerophonic elements in OF is cognitively and genet- ically correct, then Bellerophon may be said to double not only Perseus but himself: twice he flies on Pegasus, and twice deals death to the Chimaera (the Orca is wounded once, then killed).

As the re- formers began to dispute hitherto unquestioningly accepted ways of administering grace and truth and power, as the infallible institution of papacy, the rule of cardinals, bishops, and priests, together with the immense power of the confessional was tottering, the most basic levels of religious legitimation were shifted away from the collective bodies and rituals of the Church toward what, in the strength of the personal faith of each believer, was an altogether new emphasis on the __reading__ and interpretation of Scripture as the divine locus of a finished revelation.

It is a __reading__ that disregards all the signs of Verga's ambivalence: the carefully non-commital tone of the title; the fleeting admission that he shares with his lady-friend the boredom inspired by Aci-Trezza ('Certainly you'd never go back, and neither would I' confesses the cigar-smoking fldneur); the strong suggestion that the Malavoglia story excites not only Verga's compassion but appeals to him in a far less altruistic manner, as a challenging and exotic subject.

Like her, however, I treat the __reading__ ac- tivity of this poem seriously, and I'd like to think that the more historical interests of my essay might have benefited Schibanoff by pointing out ways Skelton reread and re- wrote for a sixteenth-century audience particular classi- cal and patristic artes legendi drawn from Plutarch, Basil, Augustine, Jerome, and Paulinus.
Frye develops the same point when he distin- guishes between the academic and the ""public critic"": So to ""appreciate"" literature and get more direct contact with it, we turn to the public critic, the Lamb or Hazlitt or Arnold or Saint-Beuve who represents the __reading__ pub- lic at its most expert and judicious.

Things become words in the writing, words become visualized objects and felt patterns of experience in the __reading__.

Davis's cautious answers to these and related questions lead us beyond the __reading__ of individual texts to our choice and use in criticism of concepts provided by other disciplines and finally to our most fundamental ""ways of thinking.""

This need to create significance out of pointless- ness also shapes the __reading__s that most of my stu- dents bring to my classes: specifically, that the meaning of the story depends on interpreting the ""clay"" as ""death""-as though this insight produced some sort of punch line, some sort of illumination that makes sense of an otherwise meaningless joke.

After a __reading__ of Wladimir Krysinski's 'Sartre et la metamorphose du cercle pirandellien', one reader was convinced that Pirandello was important for Sartre, which the reader had not known, but was baffled by such formulations as: 'La de-theatralisation du cercle pirandellien se double ainsi (in Huis clos) d'une perspective meta-referentielle polyvalente, mythologique, metaphorique, philosophique, spatiale et temporelle, virtuelle et conceptuelle.'

Such a __reading__ shows Bouvard et Pecuchet to be in a clear line of development from Madame Bovary (where the heroine tests her experience against such words as 'felicite', 'passion', and 'ivresse' derived from her __reading__ of Romantic literature) and Salammbo: both novels deal with the gap between language and life and assert that life cannot be lived according to words.

Amant's identification with the Ovidian myth- ological figures thus reinforces an unhappy vision of Amant's fall into love, a __reading__ that contradicts the interpretation of a number of critics.
In particular, the __reading__ fyne is uncertain.

Davis' answer is already given; its source is the text; but I would suggest that its source is a tradition of literary judgment at least as old as the pronouncements of Alexander Pope, a tradition that over a period of time was consolidated and became so authoritative that it acquired the status of a commonplace, which, in combination with other related commonplaces, made up the context within which the act of __reading__ occurred.

C. F.

Like most readers brought up on Frye and Bloom, I would start by assuming some kind of tension between the poet's craving for poetic naturalism and his practice of intensive and multilayered allusiveness: this assumption seems to me to be borne out in the texture of the poetry and in the self-conscious acts of poetic recognition which are involved in the process of __reading__.

Rousseau continually needed to distance himself from his __reading__ (and would, indeed, build a certain diffidence or distance from __reading__ into the Emile by insisting that the pupil will postpone acquiring the knack of it until his twelfth year); but the very appreciation of that distance is itself a reflex of his intense registration of the importance of the particular things that one has read.

This is surely true, but I would not have felt this imperative before them had I not known that what unites us is at once common and outside us, and that we are all looked at (each one of us singularly) by the one who, with each page, will have providentially deciphered and prescribed, arranged in advance, a __reading__ of what is happening here, of what makes the present scene possible, foreseeing and watching over it with the benevolent regard (since it is he who watches out to watch over us) and with all the love of someone who can say, at the moment of dying, even if he is not Christ or even Christian, hoc est meum corpus, which is given for you.

Because the poem begs a __reading__ that would substitute external for internal figures-whether that of the mind/nature dichotomy, guilt over literary indolence, justifiable destruction of the phallic mother's threat, or demonstration of poetical authority-it also begs the reader to adopt the subject-position of ravisher, importunate, as to ""meaning.
But surely the reader stumbles as well into the mis__reading__ of a London placed between two spectacu- lar conflagrations, a London that must itself become a spectacle of destruction, perhaps even of divinely ordained punishment, in order to fulfil its destiny as an even more ""glorious Sight"" than the burning cities of Rome and Jerusalem.
Usage here differs from symbolic usage in that the reader is not trying, by his __reading__, to find the intention of the text or of the author.
In the context of my __reading__, however, the change signals The Rime's link between vision and death, the specters of specu- lation.

Take her now who will!....""
Perhaps it will suffice for the present to say that the continual reference which is made to Burton's own copies of the books which are the sources of the Anatomy is so scrupulous that errors which have stood in the text since the first edition have been corrected for the first time by the adroit tracing of Burton's processes of thought between his __reading__ and his writing.
A school of studies is likely to bring to the __reading__ of a literary text principles of interpretation that will be shared only by adherents of that school.

Instead, building intelligently on Hill's picture (and correcting some of the __reading__s in that book), Turner regards Milton as someone in a dialogue with a libertine tradition, from Aretino to Donne, so that 'the divorce tracts provide a sort of reversal of Aretino's Postures, a series of portraits of copulation in which its fluids turn to repulsive excreta, its passionate movements are reduced to the ""grinding"" of an animal or blinded giant in the mill'.
After listing the names of theories on the blackboard for his freshmen and sopho- mores, Jay then asks them in subsequent discussions to make refer- ence to that list: ""Are we utilizing the theories of psychoanalysis in deciphering 'Young Goodman Brown,' and if so what strengths and weaknesses can we expect in our __reading__?""
But Feingold's study is distinguished by the sensitivity and perceptiveness of his __reading__s of poems with which we are all familiar, but which he manages to discuss in freshly revealing ways.

As Charles Taylor puts it, ""we are trying to establish a __reading__ for the whole text, and for this we appeal to __reading__s of its partial expressions; and yet because we are dealing with meaning, with making sense, where expressions only make sense or not in relation to others, the __reading__s of partial expressions depend on those of others, and ultimately of the whole.

The same Eurocentric perspective, however, is implicit in a __reading__ of Emecheta that not only consciously strives to avoid the search for authentic identities but uses Emecheta's work precisely in order to deconstruct notions of authenticity and identity.
Cunningham wants to breach the walls of the '__reading__ gaol', yet his sixty-page chapter on 'Word and World' ends with a twenty-page rampart of footnotes.

Her interesting presentation of the recurrent and changing concerns of readers of the poem over six centuries might better be read together with Anne Hudson's epilogue, 'The Legacy of Piers Plowman', which traces the consumption of the poem in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries to the regrettable conclusion that it was 'more honoured in the name than in the __reading__'.

Undoubtedly Notker translates the __reading__ of the Latin augustam 'imperial' that Tax puts into the text; but Notker's surviving Latin source manuscript and the unique copy of his own text agree on the __reading__ angustam, 'narrow', and it is therefore surely misleading to hide this interesting disparity between the Latin text and the German translation (which may derive from a commentary) by placing the conjectural lectiofacilior unmarked in the text.
Each of the thirty-two chapters discusses a subject in the study of the language (e.g., stressed vowels, sub- junctive mood) and includes an exer- cise based on a __reading__ of an Occitan text that has been edited afresh for this volume.An essential glossary analyzes every occurrence of every word in the __reading__s and gives cognates in other Romance languages as well as the source of each word in Latin or other languages.The book also contains a list of prefixes, infixes, and suffixes and a dictionary of proper names.

Here it might be objected that such a __reading__ derives whatever plausibility it has from the comparison with Crane, and in a sense this is true: my claim is precisely that it's only against the background of Crane's seemingly bizarre but, in this regard, normative or centric enterprise that the wider problematic of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century literary ""impressionism"" can be made out.
Thus, though Tarr provokes 'recoil', 'this is no reason to ignore the novel', and Professor Levenson makes persuasive use of his __reading__ both in contradistinction to the analysis of 'radical innocence' in The Good Soldier and in extension of an understanding of processes of characterization, showing how Lewis, 'even more explicit than James in making the requirements of formal structure dictate the behaviour of individuals', inverts familiar expectations of human particularity so that 'by the end of the novel every major character has been described as a variant upon another'.
The Stevens recording is particularly striking: few readers could take Stevens's very slow pace on the poem and still keep it resonant and distinct; 'The Idea' expresses some of his deepest beliefs and the mode of the __reading__, meditative to the point of reverie, suggests how his vision formed itself.

He is right on target when he argues for a __reading__ of the prefaces within the context of the Edition as authorial performance-which is to say, within the context of the 'semiotic field' in which they originally appeared.""
The first part of his investigation discusses ways of uncovering meaning in the speech acts on stage, the significance of stage directions in the __reading__ and ultimately in the performance of theatre texts, and the influence (implicit or explicit) of intertextual devices such as the title of a play, which may make a complex comment on the content."
1990,verb,55,0.06555423122765197,70.9090909090909,"Whereas Frei argued that German historical criticism was impoverished by an absence of a strong tradition of the novel in German literature, Prickett claims that it was precisely the existence of such a tradition in English which encouraged us to continue __reading__ the Bible as a novel, a single story albeit with a complex plot.
No siglum is used to identify __reading__s which come from the copy-text, a practice which can easily cause obscurity and confusion.

Specu- lation becomes wilder as more non-evidence is adduced: when Hamlet appears __reading__ the book of a 'satirical rogue' (perhaps Juvenal), we should 'assume that Hamlet means Lucian, who achieves his satire through his art of comic dialogue: is it not this same strategy of comic and satiric dialogue which Hamlet is directing in this situation towards Polonius?'
And yet, it is not as though __reading__ has not been the object of continual attention, from the American fascination after the war with ""close __reading__"" to the work of the deconstructionists: a revolution has taken place that has made __reading__ the very center of its concern.
The chapter on the Trecento commentaries is a model of how to read __reading__s, providing detailed and convincing analyses of the generally eclectic use made of materials and knowledge from beyond the poem, and offering in addition a lesson on what can and cannot be inferred in historical reconstructions.

They also include cultural essays to develop __reading__ skills.
The contradiction Kennedy claims to have found looks like the kind of factitious paradox that second-rate literary critics have la- bored to confect for a half-century now under the impression that they were doing their job; if you are in a dark mood about the habits of our profession, this is not a book to be __reading__.
Sandqvist is a conservative editor (no correction of so many hypometric and hypermetric lines to achieve a regular octosyllabic line), but handles his difficult text very well, leaving me with only one reservation: it is unnecessary to cite en sengna, ia senne, sa prestoit as rejected __reading__s corresponding to the printed ensengna, i asenne, s'aprestoit, since arbitrary word division in medieval French manuscripts is a commonplace and normally receives no attention in the apparatus criticus of an edition.
But this does not make __reading__ the text any easier, however.
It will be required __reading__.
The trick would be, as everyone in the field understands, to read in a way that uncovers the agency of the colonized even though the texts one is __reading__ are virtually always and only the colonizers' narratives.

This is an important book, which will be returned to time and again for its splendid wealth of bibliographical detail and which will surely be required __reading__ for students for its highly judicious, clear, and concise surveys of topics such as metre and poetic diction in general (figurative devices including kennings and similes, personification and allegory, and so on), Germanic fatalism, and the Christian elements in Beowulf (though I look in vain for a reference to Bruce Mitchell on sopfiestra dom, probably because of the time gap between writing and publication).
These studies are ""__reading__s"" only by extension because they use __reading__ as a mode of analysis, as a means.
James actually posits the telegraphist's anagnoritic moment as almost metafictional: her comprehension of the oldness of the story is precisely what constitutes the newness of her as a heroine-a heroine, educated through a vicarious experiencing of life through texts, who finally understands that the texts she has been __reading__ (and measuring life by) are deceptive and scarcely worth the effort, and is thereby able to reformulate the Wildean dictum about life's imitation of art.
In a letter to Felix Weltsch, Kafka writes of having been so ""aufgeregt"" 'excited' by the book that he had to stop __reading__ it for two days.
Wayne Booth's wonderfully lucid and irascible essay demonstrates the virtues of deep __reading__ and lambastes '__reading__ against', although the latter sometimes saves a text from the incompatibility of its premises and ours, without forcing either the text or the interpreter to tell lies.
's intention is a mis__reading__, since ""all __reading__ is mis__reading__"" and the author's intention is irrelevant anyway.

Sherry’s historical __reading__ of the modernists would have benefited from a less linear, indeed a more “cunning” sense of his- tory, one that would allow him to follow his writers as they turn, first this way, then that, going forward, sometimes retracing their steps as they make their way through the labyrinthine passages devised by history—and by their own imaginations.
And while scholarship has tended to deploy a Darwinian model of contestation and supremacy to describe the emergence of a modern idea of the author, and while, as Jeffrey Masten suggests, there has been an unwarranted assumption that early modern writers craved the dawning of an authorial age, Saenger's careful __reading__ of prefatory texts highlights collaborative, 'multivocal' sources of textual agency.

What I call into question is whether these __reading__s, which each took their origin from previously pub- lished essays, really belong together in this book under the rubric of “literate experience.” In the __reading__ offered, Measure for Measure is less about legitimating or making “literate” private experience or knowledge than it is about unmasking the ruses of power.

e practice continues, even though most critics now read the letter ironically: for example, while Robert Hollander does not subscribe to the ‘conversion theory’ that splits Boccaccio’s career and position on the moral scale into two distinct parts, he has used the letter’s supposed reference to the Decameron to argue that this text clearly attracted criticism while the sexual exploits of the nymphs in the Comedia delle ninfe did not. Despite the shi away from a literal __reading__ of the text during the course of the twentieth century, the desire to believe that the letter must refer to the Decameron has been so strong that it has not only gone unquestioned, but has had to compete with other evidence which has arisen and appears to be contradictory.

The forms of directed attention cultivated by the relics in A Pair of Blue Eyes and Tess of the D’Urbervilles operate primarily on the extradiegetic level: Tess proves an emotionally exhausting __reading__ experience because Tess’s hopeful faith in the past’s oblivion cuts against the reader’s percep- tion of the determining influence of her social context.

Marvell’s elegy for Cromwell is a neglected part of his canon, sometimes presented as an anticlimax after The First Anniversary; in a sensitive and historically astute __reading__, Holberton argues that the poem anticipates such a response only to challenge its assumptions and that Marvell presents Cromwell’s regime as shaping a new image of a semimonarchical household following the standards of a godly and nonaristocratic household.
Her final __reading__ of Jonson’s masque carries forward the theme of reconciliation: Jonson’s classical citations fuse the ancient histories of Europe and Africa, and through analogy suggest the desired unity of England and Scotland in the wake of James’s accession.
e intro- duction presents a new illuminating __reading__ of this complexly articulated corpus of texts, uncovering the autobiographical and metaliterary perspectives of Dante’s Latin poems, which were composed at the same time as the ending of the Paradiso and which contain the author’s declaration of his own poetics and his reflections on the Commedia.

In contrast to the significant role played by women in the texts as protagonists and dedicatees, there is very little, if any, evidence of an actual female readership. is makes it more tempting than ever to read Boccaccio’s comments in Epistle  as a reflection of female __reading__ practice, but I suggest that this should be done with extreme caution.
Dante’s Monarchia is also helpfully used to differentiate between Dante-pilgrim’s accidental and temporary deception of Cavalcante as to Guido’s fate and the deliberate, wilful mis__reading__ that is characteristic of heresy.

First, that because there are so many more books and authors in the modern period, “patterns of influence” change radically; earlier authors had “sufficient time to sample (read) very broadly from the full range of historically published works,” while “for more recent authors, the number of possible choices of books to read has increased dramatically, and with a finite amount of time, a subset of these works must be chosen, leading to rather heterogeneous __reading__ patterns and a greater overall diversity of authored works.” In other words, where older authors read what we now retrospectively call the canon—which is to say, the works of their accomplished predecessors, often understood as such— more recent authors read episodically and in a nonlinear or nonhistori- cized fashion, in part because there’s so much to read, and sampling it has no compelling direction.

What I would emphasize here, however, is the degree to which this tragic vision does coincide with Madison's conception of the Constitution—not as a matter of Madison's or the constitutionalists' historical __reading__ but rather for cathartic and constructive pur poses of our own construction and conception of the document through tragedy.

Wakelin cites earlier case studies as well as his own study of the Huntington Library's English manuscripts to illustrate his points, and these examples breathe life into what might otherwise have been a dull recitation of statistics: one bureau cratic scribe is so set upon accurately reproducing the author's text that he compares several versions to find the best __reading__; another returns to his previously copied work years later to make corrections from a more accurate exemplar that has come into his hands.

There is nothing inherently revolutionary about the kind of direc- tion Capell chooses to provide; extant early modern plays often deploy directions indicative of sequential actions that highlight the rift between time-spent-__reading__ and time-spent-seeing/imagining - indeed, the Folio text of Antony and Cleopatra includes this direction earlier in the play: 'Camidius Marcheth with his Land Army one way ouer the / Stage, and Towrus the Lieutenant ofCœsar the other way: / After their going in, is heard the noise of a Sea-fight.

v. BEDTIME STORIES As tropes of children's __reading__, both postures—liminal, suspended, static, upright, interruptible, mobile, social, affectionate, brotherly or sisterly—and places—domestic, pastoral, en route, or even placeless— are joined, toward the end of the nineteenth century, by the newly promoted activity of __reading__ in bed.

Rare are the comics that are not arranged to determine the proper sequence of __reading__.
Evelyn's choice of text, given its defence of classical models and its peculiarly deconstructed images of the architectural orders, and his presentation of the work to a patron faced with having to rebuild crown, city, and nation alike, serve as a final example of the rich intersection of __reading__, writing, and building in seventeenth-century England.
In working through some of Wittgenstein's remarks on music and poetry in Zettel and applying them to the __reading__ of a poem, I hope to suggest that Wittgenstein does not give us a ""new"" way of __reading__ a poem, but perhaps does give us some tools for clearing up misunder standings about our process of __reading__.

Even though Englund uses the some- what simplistic metaphor of __reading__ Celan’s poems through the filter of musical compositions—failing to take account of the fact that references are usually frac- tured in Celan’s poetry and cannot be treated as analogies—his approach convin- cingly shows that musical adaptations of Celan’s poetry, their sonic strata, texture, and pitch, oen uncover the interrelations and hierarchies between different mean- ings and __reading__s of a poem.
In his account of __reading__ Treasure Island , then, James personifies the potential space, the space of experience, as ""the young reader and his state of mind"" in the same gesture by which he projects his __reading__ experience into the figure of that boy reader.
In this Taathaam is a comic version of the Canon of Toledo, who offers a normative, corrective response to Quixote's mistakes of __reading__ at the end of the first volume of Cervantes's novel.

Without contraries is no progression; let Culler’s, or Warton’s, or Al- bright’s, claim—that “lyric” has almost always been with us in some form, even if it is not called by that name; even if it does not dominate every liter- ary period where it occurs—stand as the contrary, or the antithesis, to the New Lyric Studies’ claim that “lyricization” occludes the categories and the ways of __reading__ of even the recent past.
is brief recapitulation does nothing, however, to evoke the disrupted and confusing nature of the prose, the strange dreams about vampires that Butor weaves into the narrative, the lists of specialized terms and words that render much of the text difficult to read, nor indeed the magical enthusiasm for ideas and for __reading__ that is so fresh and alive on nearly every page.
In the following I make a first foray into __reading__ Coetzee's novel in light of this question: as an investigation of the workings of desire in art, and specifically how the novel's affective power might be driven by (even as it explores the cost of following) that desire—even desire that thrills at the intensities of transgressive violence and perversion.
Readers mystified by Hughes’s Goddess—and there can’t be only a few—will be especially grateful for Corcoran’s patient and largely sympathetic exposition of that remarkable work, which generates out of Venus and Adonis and Lucrece an equation for __reading__ all of Shakespeare in the wider socioreligious context of the Protestant Reformation leading up to the English Civil War.

with one attribute missing from Cummin’s heroine and anti-heroine alike: the capacity to feel sexual desire for the hero’.e sexual promiscuousness implicit in Emma’s, Gerty’s, and Gladys’s transgressive desire—we can think of Emma’s veiled cab ride with her new lover Léon through the streets of Rouen, Gerty’s awareness of Bloom’s masturbation and her rapturous orgas- mic Os, and Gladys’s sexual permissiveness and genital gratification—became one of the most significant moral predicaments about the dangers of __reading__ corrupting books.

Suppose that on __reading__ Keats' Ode to a Nightingale we wish to know the connotations, in early nineteenth- century English, of the word darkling ('Darkling I listen; and, for many a time, I have been half in love with easeful Death') - that is, whether at the time Keats wrote, darkling could be neutrally employed as an adverbial phrase meaning 'in the dark' or whether it had the poetic associations it carries today.

Kate Roy’s chapter on the different ways in which Emily Reute’sMemorien einer arabischen Prinzessin () has been rewritten by contemporary authors and film-makers similarly understands ‘ethical’ as a measure of how ‘fairly’/‘unfairly’ a particular group or person is represented and thereby perhaps risks becoming overly ‘normative’ herself, but her __reading__ of Diaz’s film Die Prinzessin von Sansibar (), Buch’s Sansibar Blues (), and Vosseler’s Sterne über Sansibar () is thoughtful, well researched, and theoret- ically informed in its application of a Deleuzian framework.

In the __reading__ experience that Coetzee's Dostoevsky describes, the act of 'giving [one]self up' to the text is not primarily menaced by what the text might say 'politically' or 'historically' (in this text, the censor's worry) but by the fact that true __reading__, like writing, is vertiginous, a kind of falling.
While disagreeing with his __reading__s of both characters and their plays in many respects, I do think that some illuminating connections can be made between the characters, as my discussion of King Lear will show.

Indeed, this text may bring to mind an earlier study of a tick undertaken by the biologist Jakob von Uexküll, considered the forerunner of biosemiotics and one of the first to view animals as subjects. In his book A Stroll through the Worlds of Animals and Men he describes the manner in which the tick constructs and interprets its own particular environment or Umwelt through its perceptions and actions. His research has profoundly influenced the work of the zoosemioticianomas Sebeok, for whom the process of message exchange or the __reading__ of signs is the foundation of life itself. Indeed, in Haï Le Clézio refers to ‘cette réalité pleine de signes’ (p. ), affirming that ‘le regard n’est rien d’autre que la lecture des signes’ (p. ).

I am, however, concerned to show that our __reading__ practice is dif ferently grounded, on opposed premises.
‘e dynamics of repression and the return of the repressed’—to return to Brooks’s formulation—‘figure the plot of melodrama.’en Ferrante’s metaphor—writing as ‘if butchering eels’—is straight melodrama, particularly if we interpret melodrama, as Brooks does in his __reading__ of Henry James, as ‘fiction that turns around the problem of the pregnant void or abyss, sounding its depths in the effort to know what is unknowable but which nonetheless confers upon the knowable its charge of meaning and affect’; hence the overcharged gestures of melodrama, that both indicate and mask the abyss, or, to use again Brooks’s formulation, quoting Henry James, ‘the thing hideously behind, the latent lurking horror, concealed by manners, yet just visible through them’. .
Nina Mindt takes the account up to the present day, dealing with translation theories, many of which rehearse older notions in modern guise (such as Schadewaldt’s ‘Fruchtbarmachung’, ‘schöpferische Tat’, ‘Kulturwollen’) but which are in the final analysis concerned with bringing a hard and intractable medium to a __reading__ public and—increasingly—to an audience in the theatre.

This unsettled and unsettling coexistence of self and other in the __reading__ and writing process is best expressed by a concept that Der- rida first proposed three years before the publication of 'The Deaths of Roland Barthes,"" a concept that elucidates my own attempt to speak of an author who speaks to me from a previous generation.
In this one-directional account of the __reading__ process, recognition cannot result from social interaction and thus seems to lack a reciprocal dimension.
