According to the Liverpool Saturday's Advertiser, whose account was written by a special constable, the Act was read-but an examination of the constable's evidence on the point brings out the fact that he did not hear ***THE READING***, but that he based his opinion on the circumstance that ""the magis- trates, with the constables and officers of the town passed down the line, and remained near the hustings as long as it would take to read the Riot Act.

However, the preference given to ***THE READING*** of the Vulgate does not of necessity force us to reject ***THE READING*** of the Thomas redaction; for there is the possibility that ***THE READING*** of the original was an addi- tion of both of them.
This assumption is admissible only if ***THE READING*** of the Thomas redaction is compatible with that of the Vulgate.

From these passages it will be seen that ***THE READING*** of Qi under discussion gains full support.

The sections on ***THE READING*** of the two writers are carefully and skilfully put together: they give us not merely a list of the books which there is reason to think Defoe or Swift had read, but the reader's judgment of the books wherever it is expressed.
De Wailly, in choosing ***THE READING*** of ABD, takes the relative clause as referring to his son Jean I; but this interpretation seems to me forced, and H's reading, supported by CEF, preferable.

As I have looked in vain through all of Tasso's works for this couplet, and as it seems to tally so naturally with the poet's in- creasingly wistful mood in these annotations and so appropriately and dramatically to crown them, I have become convinced that these two lines were not quoted, but directly occasioned by ***THE READING*** of Horace's words.

If we keep to ***THE READING*** of the MSS.
A still closer adherence to the French (A toutes est la foire plaine En tous les jours de la semaine) would probably lead him to adopt completely ***THE READING*** in C, Eche day in al pe sere pe feire is per iliche plenere, instead of adopting it in part and in part keeping ***THE READING*** of A.
In a few lines it would seem better to preserve ***THE READING*** of A unaltered.

Out of ***THE READING*** of two or three magazine articles, a few visits to the British Museum, a few stored-up fragments of schoolboy learning, a few scraps of contemporary talk, he created an ancient majestic world, new to him and glowing with life.
Was his desire to re-establish his ruined reputation so strong that he was willing to conform, either in bitter irony or in pure cowardice, with the opinions of a Senate which had lately forbidden ***THE READING*** of Erasmus and Bude in its university and conferred the title of Ciceronianus as the crown of literary achievement?

If we accept the division of scenes made by Spedding and turn to ***THE READING*** of the original play, we may, I think, by the simple device of reading the Shakespearean scenes apart from the others see what that idea was, and we will find that it was less a companion for such a play as Henry the Fifth-as has been suggested-than for a Timon of Athens or a Lear.
During ***THE READING*** of the last paper the Chair was occupied by Professor Fred N. Scott.
***THE READING*** of A alone satisfies the requirements of sense and metre, and has every appearance of authenticity.

They have probably preserved ***THE READING*** of the common source, though not necessarily what the poet wrote.
In the first case, as we have said, we need never hesitate to choose A B, in the second we have B matched against A, and have to decide whether ***THE READING*** in B is Cowley's correction or the printer's error.

An early copyist, failing to realise that the words 'uomo vero' referred to 'Cristo' at the beginning of the sentence, took them to refer to the name immediately preceding them, which being that of a woman,'Anna,' he corrected it to 'Adamo,' thus giving rise to ***THE READING***, as punctuated in all the earliest editions, 'Cristo, figliuolo del sovrano Iddio, e figliuolo di Maria Vergine, femmina veramente, e figlia di Giovacchino, e d' Adamo uomo veramente-: il quale fu morto da noi.'
Dr Bertalot gives ***THE READING*** of the MS. in his apparatus criticus, and in his text reads docet, which is as unsatisfactory as facit or cogit from the point of view of the cursus, while it is certainly not an improvement on either so far as the meaning is concerned.
Where the Latin source, the style or the context give sufficient indications of ***THE READING*** of the MS. in its perfect state, I have tried to fill gaps due to crumbling.

Professor Delattre writes in the happiest French style, and ***THE READING*** of his book gives pleasure of the best literary quality.
***THE READING*** of this able and accurately documented study of two English poets, hardly known till our day to continental readers, gives one, as do several French studies, an uneasy feeling that this kind of critical research is better done by students trained in continental methods than by many of our own young researchers, a criticism which falls perhaps as heavily on us who are responsible for their training as on the young explorers.
In his edition just mentioned, Koch notes ***THE READING*** ""Cambiuskan"" in the Cambridge University Library MS Dd.
He also discusses a certain number of passages, one or two of which had been overlooked by me, in which, in his opinion, ***THE READING*** of the Berlin MS. has been either insufficiently considered, or wrongly rejected.

***THE READING*** in this MS. is: 'nam ab oriente Alamannos habent et ab occidente et septentrione angallico mari vallati sunt et montibus Aragoniae terminati,' that is, France of the langue d'oUl is bounded on the East by Germany, and (assuming, as recent editors have done, that angallico is merely a blunder for anglico) on the West and North by the English Channel, with the Pyrenees as the terminus.

For 'Grandiosa modo vocabula,' ***THE READING*** of the Grenoble and Trivulzian MSS.

For ***THE READING*** of this book is likely, to do harm, by conveying to the non- specialist the notion that Milton owes a great debt to Lactantius- a conclusion which is not even Miss Hartwell's conclusion.
Elyot is convinced of the benefits of history in molding the ideal governor, and recommends ***THE READING*** of Silius Italicus and Lucan among others.

The same admiration, and the same misgiving, are present at ***THE READING*** of the Appendices.
As fitting prelude to ***THE READING*** of these glorious tales, the rest of the Mercury dealt with such matters as the sad state of two gentlewomen with a violent passion for a gentleman who fears to marry either lest the other take some desperate course; the lamentable condition of a young lady who so grieves for want of a husband that it would move a heart of stone; and the sins and irregularities of an adulterous wife detected by an apprentice.
But Shakespeare cannot intend to identify these students with a school of night or of atheism, since the disputed phrase occurs in one of the King's speeches, and if ***THE READING*** is correct he associates the school with dungeons and with hell.

The fact that the Chronological and Historical Assistant bore a more than incidental resemblance to Tennemann's historical tables, that even the scanty newspaper reports found by J. D.

If he can show that ***THE READING*** of B- can have been derived by corruption from that of C-, then there is little doubt that the C- reading is the correct one for both texts.
It will, however, be easier to justify the arbitrary emendation from C- if the general presumption of C-'s correctness is borne out by other considerations, such as the relation of ***THE READING*** to the sense of the passage in which it occurs, or the possibility that B-'s reading may have derived from that of C-.

These factors also pertain to ***THE READING*** of fiction, which is a linguistic action in the sense that it involves an understanding of the text, or of what the text seeks to convey, by establishing a relationship between text and reader.
Men of culture, in Cambridge, in London, throughout Britain, whose thoughts were conditioned by ***THE READING*** of Shakespeare and other great masters, men rooted too, even when agnostic, in the ethics of Christianity, thought alike on this matter.
Prejudices develop against ***THE READING*** of certain books, the seeing of certain pictures, and conversely for anything that has the aura or atmosphere or feel of novelty or historical inevitability.
And lastly, it usually offers a critique, catholic and thorough, as a stimulant to understanding and guide to ***THE READING*** of the work.
Modern editions such as the Loeb vary frequently from sixteenth-century ones, and at this point ***THE READING*** of Marlowe's text would not be viris but procis-wooers.
Nowhere is this more clear than in ***THE READING*** of Pericles, in many ways the most difficult task set by the author, and in all ways exemplary of his technique.

Thus the natural explanation (hallucinations) would be equivalent to the ""literal"" level in allegory, with a touch also of the ""moral"" level, and the supernatural explanation (ghosts) would be equivalent to the ""allegorical,"" the ""moral,"" and the ""anagogic"" levels, according to the richness of ***THE READING*** (Todorov considerably simplifies his definition of allegory into two levels only, the literal and the allegorical, fusing in fact, for the fable, allegorical and moral).
Hence ***THE READING*** of this crux remains rather more limited and thesis-bound than it might have been.
***THE READING*** of the oeuvre is important, and ***THE READING*** of the poem is the best we are likely to have for a good many years.""
But in fact this justifi- cation is soon forgotten and ***THE READING*** of the work forever postponed, so endless is the task of strengthening one's gloss by new confrontations with new facts and new texts.
One could speak of silences-not the silence-of the narrator, alluding by this to something else: to insertions in the verbal structure whose function is to place in relief what is said through an awareness of what is not said, or to stimu- late the reader to participate more actively in ***THE READING*** of the text.
Mr. Pearsall argues that in some ways, then, ***THE READING*** of Lydgate can be seen as the essential preface to ***THE READING*** of Chaucer.
When that addition depends on ***THE READING*** of such well-worn pieces of evidence as Gawain's shield, the temptations and confessions, and his troublesome use of the word couetyse, hesitation grows deeper still, like Gawain's blush.
At any rate Schone has given a practical lead here in a valuable little book based on painstaking research, ***THE READING*** of which is a scholarly delight.
***THE READING*** of the oeuvre is impor- tant, and ***THE READING*** of the poem is the best we are likely to have for a good many years.""
Those who chose the latter were able to discuss the contemporary literary scene in Russia with Brodsky following ***THE READING***.
This would not lead to a refinement of the question that remained precariously suspended at the end of ***THE READING*** of the Profession defoi, when the referential power of the allegorical narrative seemed to be at its most effective when its epis- temological authority was most thoroughly discredited.
Here there is more room for disagreement, and even for a suspicion that conclusions based on the Betrachtungen have determined ***THE READING*** of what came before.
Questions for oral/ written practice and composi- tion/discussion exercises en- courage students' personal re- actions to ***THE READING***.
***THE READING*** of literature is in large part a search for the organizing patterns (one of Abrams' ""controls"") that will make coherent all the numerous details or signals we pick up along the way.
So that, he continues, the student of literature, who is to be introduced to visual materials to enlarge his historical sensibility, has yet to be instructed in ***THE READING*** of them.
Articles in PMLA are also, of course, intended for future consultation, but the hope is that, unlike most scholarly articles, those appearing in PMLA -which have had up to nine favorable readings before acceptance-are of such importance that they can be read by scholars with the same interest, if not fervor, that one brings to ***THE READING*** of an article in, say, Harper's or The New Yorker.
This has neces- sitated ***THE READING*** of such works as those of Berzelius, and intensive research into scientific archives.
***THE READING*** elicited 'loud raps', which the critic took to signify the poet's approval.
The honesty lies both in the author's refusal to over-assess the value of his dis- coveries and the infrequency with which he yields to the comparative critic's besetting sin of perverting ***THE READING*** of one poem to make it fit more harmoniously with his interpretation of the other.
If, on the other hand, Mr. Kinkead-Weekes wants to describe ***THE READING*** of the books I believe he will have to reckon again with my arguments about Clarissa (arguments he disputes with great cogency and force, I am bound to admit) that the 'moments' of the novel are critical moments, fraught with anxiety, and inflicting severe damage on the continuity of experience both for the characters and the readers.
It will be seen that this supports ***THE READING*** of Eliot's phrase as noun followed by adjective.
Just as awareness of the secondary Latin sense of immobilis, 'unalterable, immutable', underlies the obvious meaning of immobile, enriching the connotations of the first line, so awareness of a French poetic background may enrich ***THE READING*** of Eifu, implicitly widening its reference.
The lengthy analysis of whole works in terms of a single topos is not an exercise that is likely to produce page after page of exciting results, but Mrs Crampton is offering a pattern, not a set of answers; and an understanding of the pattern, such as this book creates or sharpens, is a valuable critical instrument in ***THE READING*** of literature of all kinds.
Whereas ***THE READING*** of a tragedy is a fine abstraction.
Nor need this sort of attention be confined simply to ***THE READING*** of individual works.
***THE READING*** of Poisson soluble acknowledges the success of the thematic approach already employed by Gracq and Audoin and offers instead an admirable analysis of the way this text operates through the inter- action of semantic and phonetic associations swiftly changing track at the inter- section of various generateurs.
In ***THE READING*** of this tale, then, we see that the definition of events depends on the point of view of the moralist-teller, not the more usually described events seen by some hypothetical disinterested observer.
Yet this is a remarkable book, a close study of which must enrich ***THE READING*** of Hardy's poetry and provide many new insights.
But is ***THE READING*** all that clear?
***THE READING*** of I. vi.
Where ***THE READING*** of these poems is not commonplace it is strained.
***THE READING*** itself is stimulating and profound.
***THE READING*** should presumably be 'Fuit', with a reference (if such is necessary) to A~'neid, ii.
The position I have elaborated in this paper offers the opposite point of view, a view sympa- thetic in this respect with ***THE READING*** suggested by Stanley E. Fish.
Elton and Eliot concur in defining a stage when such readers can develop a more mature and objective attitude towards ***THE READING*** of great literature.
Only rarely does ***THE READING*** of the plays seem prompted by the theory, although one may detect an occasional tendency toward minimizing some moments in the tragedies that might tend to blur the structural picture, such as when ironies that occur in acts other than the fourth are underplayed.
This change occurs obviously in ***THE READING*** of individual works: ""At a certain point in the narrative, the point which Aristotle calls anagnorisis or recognition, the sense of linear continuity or participation in the action changes perspective, and what we now see is a total design or unifying structure in the narrative.
The differences between the two verbal descriptions, The one made from ***THE READING*** of the manuscript itself, the other from reading of the frames of the microfilm, are noteworthy.
While its major concern is not the same, in its broad argument this article supports ***THE READING*** of the Pardoner presented in this essay.
How tempting it would be to carry the point even farther, and to conclude that ***THE READING*** of Of Wisdome sparked off Tristram Shandy itself, that Sterne discovered in it a means of illustrating Locke's theory and pushing it to a logical extreme.
***THE READING*** of Absalom and Achitophel states, in the end, the commonplace; that is, once you have found your way through the parentheses and clotted vocabulary (e.g.
Similarly, ***THE READING*** of MacFlecknoe adds nothing to current commentary on that poem.
""Individual genius,"" if one can still refer to it as such, would receive ""a clinical document ***THE READING*** of which will be able to lead to the discovery of the deficiencies.""

and more and more I found that I was simplifying my poems... to improve ***THE READING***.""
***THE READING*** of Marvell's ""Garden"" displays the same characteris- tics.
""SupplM- ment"" is a perfect example since out of the word he finds in Rousseau, Derrida has built a small repertory of words, including ""supplimentaritt,"" and the ""supplement"" of one thing and the other, all of which have had evident uses in ***THE READING*** of other texts.
***THE READING*** in Spenser has been largely the first book of The Faerie Queene, in Pope The Rape of the Lock and often The Dunciad IV, in Wordsworth substantial selections from The Prelude, and in Eliot The Waste Land.
The contract, which shapes ***THE READING***, already guides the writing (even if, between the moment of writing and that of pub- lishing, I change the contract).
Unfortunately, the line provides the author with an excuse not to have to write about the later works; analyses would have been worth ***THE READING*** and might even have rehabilitated a number of underregarded plays.
Professor Reilly's book will provide an elementary introducton to a student embarking on ***THE READING*** of Adamov's works, his critical essays, his auto- biographical writing, his original dramatic compositions, but not his translations and adaptations, though these are listed in the bibliography.",44.39890710382514

These hard-won felicities of expres- sion, so unobtrusively offered, and in ***THE READING*** so easily passed over or forgotten, may be dismissed as the mere minutiae of style; but they are a source of the book's unfailing freshness at each rereading.
I suppose one may say that ***THE READING*** of despair and ***THE READING*** of hope are denounced by one another or turn one another upside down.
If I insist that ***THE READING*** I have given is, in the respects just noted, stage-centered, it is equally important to insist that it re- mains a reading-that the conditions it observes are those not of unmediated performance but of the graphic inscription of texts.
At the level of his engagement of the narrative, that is, when the reader sees the story as identical in its relevant features to stories he must contrive in order to prepare and follow up his own vital decisions, then a process of identification is elicited by ***THE READING***.

***THE READING*** of Wells in terms of 'balances' and 'cognitive tensions' is, inevitably, a structuralist project (Huntington rather disarmingly says that part of it is charts and diagrams translated into prose) but the influence of critics like T. S. Eliot and Cleanth Brooks is equally potent.
Still Romantic Re- Vision should provoke a much-needed discussion of the character of American Romantic art and, if given ***THE READING*** it deserves, force even the most recalcitrant reader to feel the ground of his or her traditional premises shift and shake.
***THE READING*** of the intertextual relationship between La Bataille de Pharsale, La Jalousie, and A la recherche du temps perdu is neither a case of 'source hunting' nor does it refer to the cultural and ideological codes of the 'discursive space' in which the novels are embedded.
Terry Eagleton's study of Walter Benjamin includes an important discussion of The Eighteenth Brumaire that takes as its focus ***THE READING*** advanced by Mehlman in Revolution and Repetition.
He early advo- cated ***THE READING*** of Anglo-Saxon by a popular audience and championed the usefulness of that language in fields outside the strict bounds of philology, such as law, history, and literature.
Davis's cautious answers to these and related questions lead us beyond ***THE READING*** of individual texts to our choice and use in criticism of concepts provided by other disciplines and finally to our most fundamental ""ways of thinking.""
But ***THE READING*** disregards the dialectic of idealist thought, which insists that only through the mediation of the sensuous symbol (the rainbow, for example) can a vision of ultimate truths take place.
More importantly, ***THE READING*** of nature ""for the use of Mankind,"" the deriving of moral lessons from the close observation of other species, is an activity of which Fielding seems to have approved.
But that there should be a cure from ***THE READING*** of plot within the text-before its very end-and the creation of a leftover, suggests a critique of reading itself, which is possibly like the judge's sentence: human interpretation in ignorance of the true vectors of the true text.
It does ask, however, that the one who proclaims a misreading make the rule or context explicit that makes ***THE READING*** a misreading.
Its extensive bibliography, good index of subject-matter and table of contents make it easy enough to use, and as an important contribution to ***THE READING*** of Piers Plowman it should be high on ***THE READING***-list of advanced students and teachers with a serious interest in the poem.
The Ta'rfkh al-iftitdh unfortunately survives in a single manuscript of the eighth century A. H., so evaluation of ***THE READING*** is difficult; but the proposed emendation is questionable, and we have followed the traditionally-accepted view that buzza, 'hawks', is intended.
This move- ment [bouge] of ***THE READING*** is accompanied by the creation of a virtual dimension of the text, one which will disappear only when the con- cretization has been completed-on the last page of the book.
When literary canons are reified, and especially when they are sacralized, they harden to form a rocky chan- nel through which literary experience-and so ***THE READING*** of other, less communally endorsed works-must flow.
First and foremost it must contain readers, people for whom ***THE READING*** of works and belles lettres takes place alongside other events in their lives, not as a casual, one-time event, but as an element of a more or less permanent paradigm of events-recurring with conspicuous regularity in the flow of a given individual's biographical activity.
It has to be admitted that it is not easy to see the sense of this original copy, and there must be some uncertainty in any case about ***THE READING***, not only with regard to the damaged sections of the first two lines but also to whatever it was that was deleted before 'live'.
Frei describes how an increasing focus on the synoptic gospels, which are disconnected and aggregational in form, erodes ***THE READING*** of biblical narrative in general as novelistic or historylike.
Hence the con- tinued relevance of hermeneutics to ***THE READING*** of Romantic texts can only be a corrective one: it sensitizes us to the limitations of post- structuralist reading by reminding us that literature is the dynamic interaction of text and reader and not simply the interplay of text and subtext.
Much as Pound might have been tempted by ***THE READING***, he could no longer read in the old analytical way.
Yet as ***THE READING*** goes on, the reader ""sees,"" that is to say, he works out a representation of what the text is about.

He finds there in the newspaper files, for example, enough his- tory to make him comment: ""The mind / reels, starts back amazed from ***THE READING***.""
He also resists the contaminating presence of the reader, arguing that ""***THE READING*** is not 'our' reading, since it uses only the linguistic elements provided by the text itself.
Whether we find ***THE READING*** true will depend on quality of scholarship, powers of persua- sion, and our own ability to assess.
That is, through his demand for the recognition of textual analysis in its material form, McGann points to a radical break between ***THE READING*** of a poem, on the one hand, and its historical constitution (by the author) and re- constitution (by the editor), on the other.
We are told that Keats 'never troubled to master Latin, Greek and ***THE READING*** in mythology that should go with it'.
But such an argument underrates, I think, the sophistication of Defoe in his expectations of audience, expectations that are at least partly suggested by his biblical and classical allusions which, if not essential to ***THE READING*** of a novel like Crusoe, are never- theless part of the novel's resonant possibility.
***THE READING*** given of the novels is sound and accurate, constantly enlivened by telling comparisons.
***THE READING*** of Paradise Lost developed in this essay indicates the way in which metaphor permits a mimesis of the conceptual operation of speculative theology-a mimesis that discloses the founding of the concept itself.
***THE READING*** depends on a good deal of free assocation: style=stylus=penis; piece=penis ('keep my piece'); library=womb.
A similar moral preoccupation seems to govern ***THE READING*** of'The Eve of St Agnes', where the lovers' experience, including their awakening to real life, is taken to be totally isolated from the dark surrounding elements.
Curiously enough, just as Hegel alleged that ""***THE READING*** of hiero- glyphs is for itself a deaf reading and a mute writing,"" so Fenollosa believed that ""in reading Chinese we do not seem to be juggling mental counters, but to be watching things work out their own fate.
But the disparity between the human story and the writing in the narrative leads to comedy as well as pathos, and has important philosophical implications for ***THE READING*** of the text as well.
If T. S. Eliot said half a century ago that Arnold's books on religion had served their turn and could hardly be read through then, how many now even attempt ***THE READING*** (or could name a few titles)?
This is suggested by reviews that compared the story to ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" or told of the writer's responding ""with a shudder and a creepiness to the hint of the gruesome to whose contemplation we were invited-a hint that had its fulfillment in such vividness that we were glad ... to finish ***THE READING*** in the obtrusively human companionship of a crowded trolley car"" or that warned ""persons of a highly sensitive nature"" to read the story ""before nightfall, unless they wish to be thoroughly alarmed.
Though the context is the making of moral, not critical, judgments, I think that Eliot, as so often at such moments, is concerned also with both the making and ***THE READING*** of fiction, with the making of another kind of special case.
An essential novel for anyone interested in ***THE READING*** of the typical Victorian woman.
Compare Hartman's sensitive comments on irony, specifically in connection with ***THE READING*** of sacred literature, on pp.
But these detailed points, and the reservations I have expressed with regard to certain 'ideological' features of ***THE READING***, should not be felt to count too strongly; this is a bold, well-constructed, and stimulating introduction to Pope, which will serve to win new readers for his poetry-and what else can such a book achieve?
Conversion functions in St. Augustine's narrative as a form of response to ***THE READING*** of Scripture, a response within the mind to the kerygma of the text, which affirms a common ground in faith as the basis for understanding.
***THE READING*** of Samson Agonistes which emerges from this survey is far from ambiguous, however.
""Taylor's Essays on Renaissance as how Kafka understood ***THE READING*** byowl PATRcom TaYLR ""Tnd aylr's in Essays on Renaissance process and how his highly distinctive book will become a landmark in Caribbean and Third World literary/ Romance style relates to what Koelb describes as cultural studies.
In this sense we can see without too much difficulty that all narrative, in the writing and ***THE READING***, has something in common with the continuous modification of text that takes place in a psychoanalytical process (which may tempt us to relate secrets to the condensations and displacements of dreams) or in the distortions in- duced in historical narrative by metahistorical considerations.
Black on white is the manuscript or the book; ***THE READING*** of black on white (including the seeing into its soul or spirit) is a hearing with the eyes of what is said rather than written, since it is not seen.
Whereas ***THE READING*** of a written text is linear and unidimensional (from left to right or vice versa) and allows us to interpret spatialized speech as smooth or flat syntagmatic, the painted or drawn surface offers no obvious artifice which might reveal the semiotic process that is supposedly inscribed upon it.
But if the writing of poetry is, in Holderlin's terms, the translation of Spirit into appropriate form, ***THE READING*** of it cannot be merely a translating back.
A last, really baffling point: in describing the passage from Gilbert's ""American Sexual Poetics"" we mentioned above, Lentricchia seems to make completely bizarre assumptions out of what looks like a disturbing impulse to treat ***THE READING*** of a critical essay as an opportunity to project himself into a Thematic Apperception Test.
and for a return to ***THE READING*** of poetry.""
Students also receive the best rhetorical apparatus ever offered by a reader: three detailed, step-by-step analyses that ""walk"" students through ***THE READING*** of essays of different kinds; an introductory part with six essays by Booth and Gregory that persuade stu- dents of the importance of the book's struc- ture and liberal arts emphasis; and useful introductions, footnotes, questions for dis- cussion, and suggested essay topics for each text reading.
But the Folio reads 'solid' and is followed by many modern editors, including Edwards; the rest, Jenkins among them, adopt ***THE READING*** of the earlier New Cambridge, 'sullied', proposed by its editor Dover Wilson with the explanation that Quarto's 'sallied' is merely a regular alternative spelling of the word (as is clearly the case when 'sallies' occurs later in the play).
In ""Eine alltagliche Verwirrung,"" these codes, of course, exist for ***THE READING***.
But what these readings problematize (to use a Wing word) is, precisely, such discursive intent, so that either Professor Wing's statements of intent have a clear meaning which subsequent investigation reveals to be restricting, or else they use terms which acquire sense only later, as ***THE READING*** progresses, with the result that the statement of intent appears curiously hollow.
John Dominic Crossan has profitably adapted some literary speculations about metaphor to ***THE READING*** of parables.
***THE READING*** of Romeo and Juliet, which is enlarged upon from the remarks I quoted above, concludes with a curious generalization: The tenor of this argument, then, is to suggest that in Shakespeare, coitus interruptus equates somehow with comedy, while full coition invites the tragic.",42.42002781641168

The young philologist will find Dr. Forster's glossary valuable ; it is full of parallel forms from Indo-European languages, and its references to periodicals and journals will encourage him to broaden ***HIS READING***, on the right lines, when he has mastered the grammar and syntax.
The first selections in the volume are excerpts from The American notebooks which are representative of the two most significant types of entries in Haw- thorne's journals-his realistic descriptions of scenes written down from ob- servation to be used later in his writings, and suggestions for tales or sketches jotted down at random from ***HIS READING***, or from other sources.
I do not know who said that, but such a separation of the historical and the philosophical elements of the poem, of Spenser's experience and ***HIS READING***, is both unhistorical and unphilosophical.

The poems are studiously objective, even the effects of ***HIS READING*** being represent- ed as elements in an impersonal experience.""
Wordsworth was not so prone to write about ***HIS READING***, but it is difficult to believe that Wordsworth should have read Vaughan with sufficient attention to have been influenced by Vaughan to the degree that parallel passages in the poetry of the two men would suggest, without some mention of this new poet having crept into the letters of this group, and particularly into Dorothy's Journalh.
To the impartiality of Shaw's conception of Joan's character Dr Moore pays tribute, but she shows from a detailed study of the historical literature concerning the saint that, owing to Shaw's deliberate restric- tion of ***HIS READING*** of sources to Murray's translation of Quicherat, it is highly improbable that the play will live for its truth to history.
It is not improbable that Coleridge, during ***HIS READING*** for Hymns to the Elements, went through the Treatise of A. Catcott and the Account of G. Catcott; indeed, it would be strange had he not read one or both while he was in the vicinity of Bristol.
But his supreme excellence lies in this, that ***HIS READING*** had given him so sure a sense of what we would call inspiration, and, for the most part, so unerring a judgment in illustrating it and in detecting the defects in what falls short of inspiration.

Images may throw light on ***HIS READING***: on the other hand, an image demonstrably borrowed from a book, or from the common stock, should perhaps not be counted equally with others.

Ample evidence of the width of Professor Emerson's interests is given by the Bibliography of his writings originally compiled by Professor Clark S.

His sight is obfuscated, not with Mr. Howard Payne, but with others of "" the illustrious obscure,"" and ***HIS READING*** would be better employed elsewhere.
Thus it would seem that part of Carlyle's misunderstanding of the philosophic sig- nificance of Fichte's doctrines is due to the smallness of ***HIS READING*** in Fichte.
Shakespeare secures this, not by inventing an occupation for Nero, but by employing the unusual "" angler "" reference already present in his mind from ***HIS READING*** of Chaucer.
It is far more likely that the author used ""kommen,"" ""funden,"" ""bracht"" and ""worden"" because he had found these forms in ***HIS READING*** and had heard them, and that he used ""nommen"" and ""macht"" because the metre required shorter forms and because his feeling for German was not keen enough to make him realize that these forms were impossible.

From his first appearance as a writer he approached whatever subject he had in hand with a kind of fixed emotional attitude-a pattern of prejudice, it might be called-which made him sensitive to certain facts, phrases, and ideas with which he came in contact, very often in ***HIS READING***, and which he stored away in his mind for future use.""

If ***HIS READING*** of this work caused him to revise his earlier opinion of Aristotle, it did not induce him to suppress or alter any of these hostile references which, considered alone and uncorrelated with exactly contrary opinions, might lead to the conclusion that Montaigne was bitterly anti-Aristotelian.
During the period of ***HIS READING*** of the Ethics, Montaigne culled more than one hundred passages from the writings of Plato and nearly two hundred from Cicero's philosophic tracts.
Here, again, the fact that his opinions agree fundamentally with those of Aristotle regarding these questions must be attributed to chance, although it can be shown that he confirmed his statements of earlier editions by ***HIS READING*** of the Ethics, from which a few appropriate passages were interpolated in the Bordeaux manuscript.
Montaigne's drift toward epicureanism preceded ***HIS READING*** of Diogenes by several years, and his use of this writer's work was largely to confirm his earlier statements, just as he used the Ethics.
Although there is no evidence in Cooper's published correspondence that he was acquainted with Balzac's works, various indications lend plausibility, at least, to the supposition that he read Balzac; there is no question of his ability to read French; and as he was cordially re- ceived in social circles where not even politics could crowd out discus- sion of letters, he may well have encountered, either in conversation or in ***HIS READING***, some comparison of Balzac and himself, or of Balzac and their common master, Sir Walter Scott.
***HIS READING*** has the advantage of suppressing the second, redundant plus; while chronology clearly demands the present tense (fai), since the Algais, or at least the most notorious of them, Martin Algai, was very much alive in Bertran's time.
Shelley's fragment 'On the Daemon of Socrates' is not based on ***HIS READING*** of Plato, but rather on ***HIS READING*** of Xenophon's Memorabilia.
